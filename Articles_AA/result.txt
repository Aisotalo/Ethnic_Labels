It
'
s
very
difficult
!
Ideally
,
the
translator
finds
some
comparable
piece
of
wordplay
in
the
target
language
.
A
famous
series
of
publications
in
this
connexion
is
Hergé
'
s
Tintin
"
cartoon
books
,
which
are
full
of
puns
and
suchlike
in
the
original
French
,
all
of
which
have
apparently
been
rendered
by
parallel
pieces
of
wordplay
in
the
English
-
language
editions
.
I
say
apparently
"
because
I
don
'
t
know
these
bande
dessinée
publications
well
in
either
language
,
but
I
have
often
read
that
the
translations
are
a
real
tour
de
force
in
this
respect
.
Obviously
this
will
often
require
huge
ingenuity
,
and
if
the
content
"
of
the
pun
is
crucial
to
the
subject
of
a
piece
of
prose
,
it
may
be
impossible
one
can
'
t
guarantee
that
a
given
target
language
will
offer
even
a
distant
parallel
.
A
much
weaker
solution
,
sometimes
inevitable
,
is
for
the
translator
simply
to
insert
a
footnote
explaining
that
some
words
in
the
translation
worked
as
a
pun
in
the
original
.
Or
the
relevant
wording
might
just
get
omitted
from
the
translation
:
published
translations
vary
greatly
in
how
close
they
hug
the
original
text
,
sometimes
they
are
quite
free
,
and
this
will
often
be
regarded
as
justifiable
.
Geoffrey
Sampson
I
recommend
Ved
Mehta
'
s
article
A
second
voice
"
which
appeared
in
the
New
Yorker
,
and
is
also
in
his
1971
collection
called
John
is
Easy
to
Please
,
from
Farrar
,
Straus
,
&
Giroux
.
Mehta
describes
a
particular
UN
interpreter
,
George
Sherry
,
who
when
presented
with
a
Shakespearean
quote
in
the
midst
of
someone
'
s
speech
,
could
bring
up
a
similar
Shakespearean
quotation
equivalence
of
meaning
again
which
he
knew
in
the
other
language
.
I
haven
'
t
read
this
chapter
for
several
years
,
but
recall
that
Sherry
worked
between
Russian
and
English
.
And
you
may
recall
in
the
Story
of
Garp
by
John
Irving
,
the
boy
mishears
the
warning
to
watch
out
for
the
undertow
"
and
is
on
guard
for
that
sea
creature
the
undertoad
.
Swedish
friends
reported
that
this
pun
works
in
Swedish
as
underströmmen
understow
)
and
underst
-
hummen
under
-
est
-
lobster
)
Written
translation
has
the
advantage
of
time
to
search
for
such
equivalence
.
Simultaneous
translation
interpreting
)
must
do
in
in
the
moment
!
When
a
book
,
film
or
TV
program
is
translated
into
another
language
,
what
do
translators
do
when
puns
,
anagrams
or
other
wordplay
is
involved
?
To
use
one
example
,
one
mystery
story
I
read
had
the
solution
hinge
on
the
homophone
floorless
/
flawless
.
When
translated
,
this
would
break
'
and
the
premise
fails
.
Another
example
is
the
movie
Sneakers
.
The
plot
hinges
on
an
anagram
Setec
Astronomy
'
too
many
secrets
'
Various
ways
.
What
you
do
depends
on
the
kind
of
text
,
the
skill
of
the
translator
,
and
whether
or
not
there
is
an
analogous
pun
.
Anthea
Bell
,
the
translator
of
the
Asterix
and
Obelix
books
is
especially
brilliant
.
She
doesn
'
t
translate
every
pun
:
sometimes
a
pun
in
the
original
French
will
not
be
a
pun
in
English
,
while
new
puns
are
introduced
.
The
names
in
Asterix
are
all
puns
.
The
names
of
the
two
heroes
work
equally
well
in
French
and
in
English
.
But
others
don
'
t
.
The
bard
is
Assurancetourix
"
Comprehensive
Insurance
)
in
Frencg
but
Cacofonix
"
in
English
,
which
makes
a
more
appropriate
pun
for
the
character
,
this
time
.
It
'
s
a
very
interesting
thing
to
study
.
As
an
obsessive
comparer
of
translations
,
I
can
also
tell
you
that
the
way
L
'
Occitane
perfumes
are
said
to
smell
varies
quite
a
bit
from
language
to
another
!
Anthea
I
suspect
you
'
ve
noticed
that
floorless
/
flawless
are
not
homophones
for
most
speakers
on
the
west
side
of
the
Atlantic
.
so
the
problem
of
translation
exists
across
dialects
as
well
.
In
much
the
Southern
US
,
idle
/
addle
are
homophones
.
I
found
this
out
when
teaching
in
Georgia
.
I
had
used
addle
"
as
an
example
of
a
verb
that
narrowly
limits
its
subjects
.
Generally
only
brains
and
eggs
can
addle
.
When
I
said
that
,
a
student
from
Memphis
,
TN
,
said
,
But
my
car
addles
every
time
I
stop
for
a
stop
sign
!
When
I
did
translations
,
I
went
for
equivalence
in
the
target
language
,
wherever
possible
–
quite
time
-
consuming
,
but
often
great
fun
to
research
.
In
many
cases
,
though
,
even
equivalence
failed
to
work
in
the
way
intended
by
the
author
of
the
original
text
.
Footnotes
are
sometimes
used
in
such
cases
,
but
extensive
use
of
these
ends
up
defeating
the
purpose
of
a
fluent
text
.
