Why		  
many

investigation		
were		
wrong		 
WASHINGTON		  
-		
The		
somber		 
,		
gray-haired		
prosecutor		
stood		
before		
throngs		
of		
cameras		
on		
Monday		
night		
and		
considered		
the		
many		
problems		
that		
plagued		
the		
investigation		
into		
the		
killing		
of		
unarmed		
teenager		
Michael		
Brown		 
.		 
There		 
was		
the		
media		 
,		
he		
said		 
,		
and		
"		 
its		
insatiable		
appetite		
for		
something		 
,		
for		
anything		
to		
talk		
about		 
.		  
"		 
Then		
there		
was		
chatter		
of		
social		
media		
and		
its		
"		 
nonstop		
rumors		 
.		  
"		 
And		
finally		 
,		
there		
were		
the		
dozens		
of		
witnesses		 
,		
many		
of		
whom		
remembered		
conflicting		
versions		
of		
the		
same		
events

All		  
claimed		
to		
have		
seen		
the		
final		
moments		
of		
Brown		
's

St.

all		
claimed		
to		
have		
witnessed

bullets		
into

youth

But		 
that		
's		
just		
about		
where		
the		
similarities		
ended

And		 
soon		 
,		
as		
investigators		
sank		
deeper		
into		
a		
controversy		
with		
national		
implications		 
,		
it		
was		
difficult		
to		
parse		
who		
saw		
what		
and		
who		
saw		
anything		
at		
all		 
.		 
"		   
At		
least		
one		
witness		
stated		
that		
as		
Officer		
Wilson		
got		
out		
of		
his		
vehicle

he		
shot		
Mr.		
Brown		
multiple		
times		
as		
Mr.		
Brown		
stood		
next		
to		
the		
vehicle

"		
McCulloch		
said		 
.		 
"		  
Yet		
another		
witness		
stated		
that		
Officer		
Wilson		
stuck		
his		
gun		
out		
of		
the		
window		
and		
fired		
at		
Mr.		
Brown		
as		
Mr.		
Brown		
was		
running

One		 
witness		
stated		
there		
were		
actually		
two		
police		
vehicles		
and		
four		
officers		
present		 
,		
but		
only		
one		
officer		
fired
