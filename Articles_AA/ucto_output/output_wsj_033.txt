A		
grand		
jury		
declined		
to		
indict		
a		
white		
police		
officer		
in		
the		
shooting		
of		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		
whose		
death		
in		
the		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		
of		
Ferguson		
became		
a		
national		
flash		
point		
on		
race		 
,		
justice		
and		
policing		 
.		 
The		  
decision		
released		
on		
Monday		
night		
led		
to		
renewed		
unrest		
after		
the		
region		
faced		
weeks		
of		
protest		
that		
turned		
violent		
at		
times		
this		
summer		 
.		 
Police		 
within		
hours		
of		
the		
decision		
were		
using		
smoke		
canisters		 
,		
teargas		
and		
non-lethal		
shotgun		
rounds		
to		
disperse		
crowds		
in		
Ferguson		
as		
they		
reported		
incidents		
of		
looting		
and		
buildings		
being		
set		
on		
fire		 
.		 
The		  
grand		
jury		
was		
charged		
with		
determining		
whether		
a		
crime		
occurred		
when		
Ferguson		
police		
officer		
Darren		
Wilson		
shot		
18		 
-		
year-old		
Michael		
Brown		
in		
August		
after		
an		
altercation		
between		
the		
two		 
.		 
St.		 
Louis		
County		
Prosecuting		
Attorney		
Robert		
McCulloch		
said		
the		
12		 
-		 
member		
panel		
did		
n't		
find		
probable		
cause		
for		
five		
possible		
charges		
that		
ranged		
from		
first-degree		
murder		
to		
involuntary		
manslaughter		 
,		
after		
hearing		
more		
than		
70		
hours		
of		
testimony		
from		
about		
60		
witnesses		 
.		 
"		   
All		
decisions		
in		
the		
criminal-justice		
system		
must		
be		
determined		
by		
the		
physical		
and		
scientific		
evidence		 
,		
and		
the		
credible		
testimony		
corroborated		
by		
that		
evidence

Not		 
in		
response		
to		
public		
outcry		
or		
for		
political		
expediency

"		
Mr.		
McCulloch		
said		 
.		 
The		  
shooting		
of		
Mr.		
Brown		
in		
August		
gained		
national		
attention		
as		
protests		
spread		
to		
other		
cities		
and		
President		
Barack		
Obama		
and		
Congress		
weighed		
in		 
.		 
On		 
Monday		
night		 
,		
Mr.		
Obama		
urged		
calm		 
.		 
"		  
We		
need		
to		
recognize		
that		
the		
situation		
in		
Ferguson		
speaks		
to		
broader		
challenges		
that		
we		
still		
face		
as		
a		
nation		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Obama		
said		 
.		 
The		  
national		
debate		
started		
over		
the		
death		
of		
Mr.		
Brown		
and		 
,		
more		
broadly		 
,		
the		
treatment		
of		
young		 
,		
black		
men		
by		
police		 
.		 
It		 
grew		
to		
include		
how		
police		
responded		
to		
protesters		
in		
Ferguson		
and		
the		
use		
of		
surplus		
military		
equipment		
such		
as		
Humvees		
by		
local		
police		
departments		 
.		 
On		  
Monday		 
,		
the		
crowd		
gathered		
at		
the		
Ferguson		
police		
station		
initially		
reacted		
quietly		
to		
the		
grand		
jury		
decision		 
,		
but		
a		
small		
group		
attacked		
a		
police		
car		
and		
threw		
objects		
at		
police		 
.		 
Police		 
responded		
by		
firing		
crowd		
dispersal		
canisters		
they		
said		
was		
smoke

and		
later		
tear		
gas

all		
but

Ahead

were		
boarded

activated

In		  
a		
statement		 
,		
the		
Brown		
family		
said		
they		
were		
profoundly		
disappointed		
by		
the		
grand-jury		
ruling		
and		
referred		
to		
Mr.		
Wilson		
as		
a		
"		 
killer		
of		
our		
child		 
.		  
"		 
They		
called		
for		
positive		
action		
from		
people		
frustrated		
by		
the		
decision		
to		
help		
fix		
the		
legal		
system		 
,		
including		
requiring		
officers		
to		
wear		
body		
cameras		 
.		 
"		   
Answering		
violence		
with		
violence		
is		
not		
the		
appropriate		
reaction		 
,		 
"		
the		
Brown		
family		
said		
in		
a		
written		
statement		 
.		 
A		  
lawyer		
representing		
Mr.		
Wilson		
did		
n't		
return		
a		
call		
seeking		
comment		 
.		 
The		  
grand		
jury		
over		
more		
than		
three		
months		
was		
tasked		
with		
trying		
to		
unravel		
what		
happened		
on		
Aug.		
9		 
,		
when		
Mr.		
Wilson		
stopped		
Mr.		
Brown		
for		
walking		
in		
the		
street		 
.		 
Brown		 
family		
lawyers		
and		
police		
accounts		
say		
a		
struggle		
between		
the		
officer		
and		
Mr.		
Brown		
took		
place		
at		
the		
officer		
's		
cruiser		 
,		
resulting		
in		
the		
firing		
of		
Mr.		
Wilson		
's		
pistol		 
,		
and		
Mr.		
Brown		
then		
moved		
away		
from		
the		
vehicle		 
.		 
Accounts		  
of		
what		
happened		
then		
differ		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Brown		
's		
family		
says		
the		
unarmed		
teen		
put		
his		
hands		
up		
or		
out		
in		
supplication		 
,		
while		
police		
and		
pathologists		
have		
said		
Mr.		
Brown		
likely		
had		
been		
moving		
toward		
the		
officer		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Wilson		
fired		
multiple		
shots		 
,		
killing		
Mr.		
Brown		 
.		 
Mr.		  
McCulloch		
said		
many		
statements		
made		
to		
the		
media		
and		
investigators		
shortly		
after		
the		
killing		
were		
later		
recanted		 
,		
based		
on		
hearsay		
or		
contradicted		
by		
the		
evidence		 
.		 
He		 
said		 
,		
for		
example		 
,		
that		
several		
early		
accounts		
said		
that		
Mr.		
Wilson		
stood		
over		
Mr.		
Brown		
and		
fired		
several		
shots		
into		
his		
back		 
,		
but		
the		
evidence		
did		
n't		
bear		
that		
out		 
.		 
The		  
prosecutor		
also		
said		
that		
he		
could		
n't		
give		
the		
breakdown		
in		
the		
voting		
from		
jurors		 
,		
comprised		
of		
nine		
white		
members		
and		
three		
black		
members		
who		
were		
seated		
before		
the		
shooting		
of		
Mr.		
Brown		 
.		 
One		  
likely		
factor		
in		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
is		
Missouri		
's		
law		
on		
"		 
use		
of		
force		 
"		
--		
or		
when		
a		
police		
officer		
is		
justified		
in		
using		
deadly		
force		
--		
which		
is		
considered		
more		
officer-friendly		
than		
that		
in		
other		
states		 
,		
said		
legal		
experts		 
.		 
"		   
It		
's		
really		
pretty		
straightforward		
--		
a		
police		
officer		
can		
use		
deadly		
force		
when		
it		
's		
necessary		
to		
prevent		
bodily		
injury		
or		
death

The		  
grand-jury		
process		
has		
been		
touched		
by		
controversy		
from		
the		
beginning		 
.		 
Mr.		 
McCulloch		
faced		
calls		
to		
step		
aside		
in		
favor		
of		
a		
special		
prosecutor		
for		
various		
reasons		 
,		
including		
the		
fact		
his		
father		
was		
a		
St.		
Louis		
police		
officer		
who		
was		
killed		
by		
an		
armed		
suspect		
50		
years		
ago		 
.		 
Then		 
came		
alleged		
leaks		
from		
those		
involved		
in		
the		
process		
and		
general		
criticisms		
of		
a		
lack		
of		
transparency		 
,		
including		
from		
Attorney		
General		
Eric		
Holder		 
.		 
The		  
Justice		
Department		
is		
conducting		
its		
own		
criminal		
investigation		
to		
see		
if		
federal		
civil-rights		
laws		
were		
violated		
in		
the		
shooting		
of		
Mr.		
Brown		 
.		 
While		 
the		
known		
facts		
of		
the		
case		
suggest		
it		
will		
be		
difficult		
to		
bring		
such		
charges		
against		
the		
officer		 
,		
that		
review		
is		
likely		
to		
take		
weeks		
or		
months		
more		 
,		
according		
to		
people		
familiar		
with		
the		
work		 
.		 
Separately		   
,		
the		
Justice		
Department		
has		
opened		
a		
civil		
investigation		
aimed		
at		
the		
entire		
Ferguson		
police		
force		 
.		 
The		 
probe		 
,		
which		
is		
exploring		
whether		
the		
Ferguson		
police		
force		
engaged		
in		
a		
"		 
pattern		
and		
practice		 
"		
of		
legal		
violations		 
,		
will		
focus		
on		
possible		
excessive		
use		
of		
force		
and		
statistics		
on		
stops		 
,		
searches		
and		
arrests		 
,		
as		
well		
as		
treatment		
of		
prisoners		
and		
discriminatory		
policing		 
,		
Justice		
Department		
officials

The		 
force		
of		
53		
officers
