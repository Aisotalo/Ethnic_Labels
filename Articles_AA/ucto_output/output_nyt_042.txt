Experts		  
Weigh		
Police		
Officer		
's		
Decisions		
Leading		
to		
Fatal		
Shooting		
of		
Teenager		 
In		  
his		
first		
public		
interview		
this		
week		 
,		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
the		
white		
police		
officer		
who		
fatally		
shot		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
,		
was		
asked		
whether		
he		
could		
have		
done		
anything		
differently		
that		
would		
have		
prevented		
the		
killing		 
.		 
His		  
answer		 
,		
broadcast		
on		
Wednesday		 
,		
to		
the		
question		
from		
George		
Stephanopoulos		
of		
ABC		
News		 
,		
was		
unequivocal		 
:		
No.		 
"		 
But		  
even		
as		
a		
grand		
jury		
decided		
this		
week		
not		
to		
indict		
Officer		
Wilson		 
,		
the		
shooting		
of		
the		
18		 
-		
year-old		 
,		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
has		
continued		
to		
raise		
questions		
about		
whether		
the		
officer		
handled		
the		
brief		
and		
deadly		
confrontation		
correctly		 
.		 
It		 
also		
has		
become		
part		
of		
a		
broader		
national		
debate		
over		
police		
tactics		
and		
potential		
racial		
bias		
in		
policing		 
.		 
And		  
with		
the		
unusual		
release		
of		
the		
evidence		
presented		
to		
the		
grand		
jury		 
,		
criminologists		
and		
experts		
in		
police		
procedure		
and		
tactics		
now		
have		
an		
extraordinarily		
detailed		
record		
with		
which		
to		
evaluate		
the		
shooting		 
,		
which		
touched		
off		
riots		
in		
Ferguson		
and		
protests		
across		
the		
country		 
.		 
To		  
many		
experts		 
,		
Officer		
Wilson		
's		
actions		
in		
the		
confrontation		
with		
Mr.		
Brown		
--		
as		
he		
described		
them		
to		
the		
grand		
jury		
--		
were		
within		
the		
bounds		
of		
standard		
police		
protocol		 
.		 
Officer		 
Wilson		
testified		
to		
the		
grand		
jury		
that		
the		
two		
struggled		
over		
his		
service		
weapon		
while		
he		
was		
still		
in		
his		
police		
vehicle		 
,		
and		
that		
later		 
,		
after		
a		
brief		
chase		 
,		
he		
fired		
the		
fatal		
shots		
at		
Mr.		
Brown		
because		
the		
teenager		
was		
coming		
toward		
him		
in		
a		
threatening		
way		 
.		 
But		  
while		
the		
precise		
timeline		
and		
exact		
circumstances		
of		
the		
shooting		
may		
never		
be		
fully		
known		 
,		
several		
law		
enforcement		
experts		
challenged		
Officer		
Wilson		
's		
assessment		
that		
nothing		
could		
have		
been		
done		
to		
change		
the		
deadly		
course		
of		
his		
confrontation		
with		
Mr.		
Brown		 
.		 
From		  
the		
time		
Officer		
Wilson		
first		
encountered		
Mr.		
Brown		
walking		
with		
a		
friend		
in		
the		
middle		
of		
the		
street		
on		
a		
hot		
afternoon		
in		
August		 
,		
to		
the		
point		
the		
teenager		
lay		
dead		
on		
the		
pavement		 
,		
there		
were		
several		
opportunities		
to		
de-escalate		
the		
confrontation		 
,		
said		
Eugene		
O		 
'		 
Donnell		 
,		
a		
professor		
at		
John		
Jay		
College		
of		
Criminal		
Justice		
and		
a		
former		
New		
York		
City		
police		
officer		 
.		 
Mr.		 
O		 
'		 
Donnell		
pointed		
in		
particular		
to		
the		
initial		
moments		
of		
the		
confrontation		 
,		
when		
the		
officer		
and		
Mr.		
Brown		
are		
said		
to		
have		
struggled		
through		
the		
open		
window		
of		
the		
officer		
's		
police		
cruiser		 
.		 
"		   
There		
certainly		
would		
n't		
be		
a		
prohibition		
of		
him		
driving		
a		
little		
further		
along		
and		
regrouping		 
,		
calling		
for		
help		
and		
thinking		
about		
nonlethal		
weaponry		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
O		 
'		 
Donnell		
said		 
,		
referring		
to		
Officer		
Wilson		 
.		 
"		  
Just		
because		
you		
're		
a		
police		
officer		
does		
n't		
mean		
you		
have		
to		
go		
into		
a		
situation		
headfirst		 
.		 
"		 
Officer		  
Wilson		 
,		
whose		
detailed		 
,		
four-hour		
grand		
jury		
testimony		
was		
among		
the		
evidence		
made		
public		
this		
week		 
,		
contends		
that		
he		
was		
caught		
up		
in		
a		
rapidly		
escalating		
confrontation		
that		
started		
as		
a		
routine		
police		
stop		
and		
quickly		
spun		
out		
of		
control		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Brown		 
,		
he		
said		 
,		
essentially		
pinned		
him		
in		
his		
police		
cruiser		 
,		
holding		
the		
door		
shut		
while		
punching		
him		
in		
the		
face		 
.		 
He		 
said		
he		
considered		
an		
array		
of		
responses		 
,		
including		
using		
pepper		
spray		
or		
his		
baton		 
,		
but		
found		
them		
all		
lacking		 
.		 
"		   
The		
only		
option		
I		
thought		
I		
had		
was		
my		
gun		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
,		
according		
to		
a		
transcript		
of		
his		
testimony		 
.		 
That		  
conclusion		
was		
confounding		
to		
Edward		
Davis		 
,		
who		
retired		
last		
year		
as		
Boston		
police		
commissioner		
after		
35		
years		
as		
an		
officer		
there		
and		
in		
Lowell		 
,		
Mass.		 
"		   
There		
has		
been		
a		
significant		
change		
in		
the		
use		
of		
force		
by		
police		
in		
the		
35		
years		
I		
've		
been		
in		
the		
business		
--		
new		
tools		
like		
Tasers		
and		
really		
effective		
pepper		
sprays		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Davis		
said		 
.		 
"		  
When		
you		
look		
at		
the		
whole		
way		
this		
situation		
transpired		 
,		
it		
's		
disappointing		
to		
see		
someone		
not		
use		
those		
intermediate		
tools		
available		 
.		 
"		 
In		  
his		
testimony		 
,		
Officer		
Wilson		
said		
that		
he		
did		
not		
have		
a		
Taser		
weapon		
with		
him		
at		
the		
time		 
,		
and		
that		
he		
preferred		
not		
to		
carry		
one		
because		
it		
is		
large		
and		
not		
"		 
very		
comfortable		 
.		  
"		 
He		
said		
he		
did		
not		
use		
mace		
because		
it		
was		
difficult		
to		
reach		
and		
the		
spray		
could		
have		
blown		
back		
at		
him		 
.		 
His		 
baton		
and		
flashlight		 
,		
he		
said		 
,		
were		
also		
inaccessible		 
.		 
In		  
his		
testimony		 
,		
Officer		
Wilson		
said		
he		
never		
had		
any		
thought		
to		
fall		
back		 
,		
even		
if		
only		
to		
make		
a		
tactical		
retreat		
to		
reassess		
and		
perhaps		
wait		
for		
backup		
officers		 
.		 
Part		 
of		
the		
reason		
is		
training		 
,		
experts		
said		 
.		 
In		 
the		
heat		
of		
a		
violent		
altercation		 
,		
police		
officers		
in		
many		
cases		
are		
trained		
to		
engage		 
,		
not		
back		
down		 
.		 
In		 
this		
case		 
,		
though		 
,		
human		
psychology		
may		
also		
have		
come		
into		
play		 
,		
said		
Vincent		
E.		
Henry		 
,		
an		
expert		
in		
the		
use		
of		
force		
by		
the		
police		
at		
the		
Homeland		
Security		
Management		
Institute		
at		
Long		
Island		
University		 
.		 
"		   
To		
back		
up		
and		
maybe		
follow		
him		
until		
backup		
arrived		 
,		
in		
retrospect		
it		
might		
have		
been		
a		
better		
choice		 
,		
but		
we		
do		
n't		
know		
that		
Officer		
Wilson		
saw		
that		
as		
a		
valid		
option		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Henry		
said		 
.		 
"		  
Who		
would		
want		
to		
get		
punched		
in		
the		
face		
and		
then		
kind		
of		
say		 
,		
'		 
Let		
me		
just		
back		
up		
and		
follow		
this		
individual		 
.		  
'		 
A		
natural		
emotional		
reaction		
is		
to		
ratchet		
it		
up		 
.		 
"		 
In		  
his		
testimony		 
,		
Officer		
Wilson		
said		
that		
when		
he		
pulled		
his		
gun		
out		 
,		
Mr.		
Brown		
reached		
through		
the		
window		
and		
grabbed		
it		 
.		 
That		 
was		
a		
major		
escalation		
from		
which		
there		
was		
probably		
no		
turning		
back		 
,		
some		
experts		
said		 
.		 
"		   
It		
's		
a		
whole		
different		
ballgame		 
,		 
"		
said		
Fred		
Bealefeld		 
,		
who		
was		
a		
Baltimore		
police		
officer		
for		
31		
years		
and		
police		
commissioner		
from		
2007		
to		
2012		 
.		 
"		  
If		
someone		
is		
trying		
to		
disarm		
a		
police		
officer		
or		
grab		
their		
weapon		 
,		
that		
's		
a		
felony		 
.		 
If		 
someone		
grabs		
your		
weapon		 
,		
as		
a		
cop		
you		
're		
not		
thinking		
they		
are		
going		
to		
scare		
you		
with		
it		 
.		 
In		 
my		
mind		 
,		
every		
time		
someone		
tried		
to		
grab		
my		
gun		
in		
the		
street		 
,		
they		
were		
going		
to		
try		
to		
kill		
me		 
.		 
That		 
encounter		
changes		
everything		 
.		 
"		 
From		  
then		
on		 
,		
most		
experts		
said		 
,		
Officer		
Wilson		
was		
very		
likely		
following		
standard		
police		
protocol		
in		
using		
whatever		
force		
was		
necessary		
to		
protect		
himself		 
.		 
But		  
for		
some		
experts		 
,		
the		
shooting		
and		
the		
events		
that		
preceded		
it		
raised		
broader		
policy		
questions		 
,		
particularly		
about		
how		
officers		
engage		
with		
communities		
they		
patrol		 
.		 
In		 
his		
initial		
encounter		
with		
Mr.		
Brown		
and		
his		
friend		
in		
the		
street		 
,		
Officer		
Wilson		
never		
exited		
his		
vehicle		 
,		
voicing		
commands		
through		
the		
window		
of		
his		
cruiser		
instead		 
.		 
"		   
The		
notion		
of		
riding		
through		
neighborhoods		
yelling		 
,		
'		 
Get		
up		
on		
the		
curb		 
'		
or		
'		 
Get		
out		
of		
the		
street		 
,		 
'		
is		
not		
where		
you		
want		
your		
officers		
to		
be		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Bealefeld		
said		 
.		 
"		  
You		
want		
them		
out		
of		
their		
cars		 
,		
engaging		
the		
public		
and		
explaining		
to		
people		
what		
it		
is		
you		
are		
trying		
to		
do		 
.		 
Drive-by		 
policing		
is		
not		
good		
for		
any		
community		 
.		 
"		 
In		  
cities		
like		
Los		
Angeles		
and		
New		
York		 
,		
police		
departments		
have		
invested		
huge		
resources		
into		
community		
outreach		
efforts		 
,		
particularly		
in		
poor		
minority		
neighborhoods		 
,		
with		
varied		
success		 
.		 
In		 
Ferguson		 
,		
where		
the		
vast		
majority		
of		
police		
officers		
are		
white		
and		
most		
of		
the		
residents		
are		
black		 
,		
many		
black		
residents		
have		
blamed		
aggressive		
policing		
for		
creating		
tensions		 
.		 
In		  
September		 
,		
weeks		
after		
the		
shooting		 
,		
the		
Justice		
Department		
announced		
that		
it		
was		
opening		
a		
broad		
civil		
rights		
investigation		
into		
whether		
the		
police		
in		
Ferguson		
have		
a		
history		
of		
discrimination		
or		
misuse		
of		
force		
amid		
complaints		
of		
racial		
profiling		 
,		
harassment		
and		
improper		
stops		
of		
black		
residents		
by		
police		
officers		 
.		 
While		  
Attorney		
General		
Eric		
H.		
Holder		
Jr.		
said		
the		
federal		
investigation		
offered		
the		
possibility		
for		
"		 
wholesale		
change		 
,		 
"		
it		
could		
take		
months		
to		
complete		 
.		 
In		  
Ferguson		 
,		
emotions		
are		
raw		
as		
many		
continue		
to		
demand		
punishment		
for		
Officer		
Wilson		 
.		 
But		 
Officer		
Wilson		 
,		
in		
his		
interview		
this		
week		 
,		
said		
he		
was		
confident		
he		
had		
done		
nothing		
wrong		 
.		 
"		   
I		
know		
that		
I		
did		
my		
job		
right
