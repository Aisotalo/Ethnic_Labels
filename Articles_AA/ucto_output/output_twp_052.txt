Of

witnesses		
who		
testified		
before		
the		
Ferguson

jury		
in		
the		
case		
of		
the		
fatal		
shooting		
of		
an		
unarmed		
Michael		
Brown

one		
offered		
a		
particularly		
vivid		
account		
that		
bolstered		
police		
officer		
Darren		
Wilson

version		
of		
events

Brown

the		
witness

Wilson

by		
Brown

that

kept		
going		
up		
and		
down

She		
said		
Brown		
was		
"		 
running		
right		
at		
the		
cop		
like		
a		
football		
player		 
,		
head		
down

But		  
the		
woman		
turns		
out		
to		
have		
made		
some		 
,		
if		
not		
all		 
,		
of		
it		
up

to

a		
federal

whose		
interview		
with		
the		
woman		
was		
played		
for		
the		
grand		
jury		 
,		
and		
then		
county		
prosecutors		
who		
brought		
the		
woman		
in		
twice		
to		
testify

poked		
holes		
in		
her		
story

They		  
also		
got		
her		
to		
admit		
she		
has		
made		
comments

that		
she		
said

be

back

Some		 
experts		
say		
that		
in

Ferguson

the		
local		
prosecutor		
would		
be		
remiss

Her		  
account		
was		
certainly		
colorful		 
:		
After		
getting		
lost		
while		
driving		
and		
looking		
for		
a		
friend		
's		
apartment		 
,		
she		
parked		
her		
car		
to		
ask		
for		
directions		
and		
saw		
the		
altercation		
between		
Brown		
and		
his		
friend		 
,		
Dorian		
Johnson		 
,		
and		
Wilson		 
,		
who		
was		
in		
his		
SUV		 
.		 
After		 
the		
officer		
exchanges		
words		
with		
the		
men		 
,		 
"		
the		
next		
thing		
I		
know		 
,		
Mike		
Brown		
was		
lunging		
into		
the		
car		 
,		
like		
dived		
in		
and		
it		
was		
only		
from		
the		
waist		
up		
that		
he		
was		
in		
the		
car		 
,		 
"		
inside		
the		
driver		
's		
window		 
,		
"		 
to		
about		
his		
belt		 
,		
navel		 
,		 
"		
she		
said		 
.		 
She		  
said		
she		
muttered		
to		
a		
bystander		 
,		
"		 
Is		
he		
f		 
-----		 
g		
crazy		 
?		 
"		 
Then		  
she		
said		
she		
saw		
Wilson		
being		
punched		
repeatedly		
by		
Brown		 
.		 
"		  
You		
knew		
he		
was		
getting		
hit		 
,		
even		
though		
he		
was		
all		
the		
way		
back

"		 
"		   
And		
then		
I		
heard		
the		
gun		
go		
off		 
.		 
"		 
Johnson		  
"		 
took		
off		
running		
and		
the		
heavier-set		
one		
that		
they		
call		
Mike		
Brown		
stood		
up		 
,		
and		
I		
seen		
him		
pull		
his		
shorts		
up		
and		
take		
off		
running		 
,		 
"		
she		
said		 
.		 
"		   
The		
officer		
got		
out		
of		
the		
car		
and		
had		
his		
left		
hand		
on		
the		
left		
side		
of		
his		
face		
and		
the		
gun		
in		
his		
right		
hand

"		
she		
said		 
.		 
"		  
And		
his		
right		
hand		
was		
shaking		 
,		
and		
he		
was		
stumbling		
from		
one		
foot		
to		
the		
other		 
,		
and		
I		
do		
n't		
know		
what		
he		
said

All		 
I		
heard		
was		 
,		
'

I		
'll		
shoot

Then		   
,		
she		
said		 
,		
that		
's		
when		
Brown		
"		 
turned		
around		
and		
face-to-face		
with		
the		
officer

he		
had		
his		
hands		
out		
extended

kind		
of

"		 
Wilson		  
had		
his		
gun		
drawn		
and		
pointed		
at		
Brown		
and		
that		
's		
when		
"		 
Brown		
started		
to		
charge

kind		
of		
like		
a		
football

like		
this

with		
his		
hands		
out

"		
she		
said		 
,		
clenching		
her		
fists		 
.		 
"		   
It		
was		
kind		
of		
like		
a		
football		
charge

and		
that		
's		
when		
the		
gunshots		
started

"		 
She		  
said		
she		
does		
n't		
remember		
the		
sequence		 
,		
but		
the		
gun		
went		
off		
a		
couple		
of		
times		 
,		
stopped		 
,		
then		
went		
off		
again		 
.		 
Brown		  
"		 
just		
looked		
like		
he		
was		
on		
something

The

shooting		
him

he		
did		
n't		
do		
anything

He		 
did		
n't		
flinch

he		
did		
n't		
wiggle

he		
just		
did		
n't		
stop

he		
just		
kept		
going

And		 
,		
she		
said		 
,		
"		 
there		
was		
a		
lot		
of		
blood

"		 
"		   
And		
then		
when		
the		
last		
gunshot		
went		
off		 
,		
which		
was		
in		
the		
head		 
,		
that		
's		
when		
I		
started		
to		
get		
freaked		
out		
and		
I		
got		
in		
my		
car		
and		
I		
left		 
,		 
"		
she		
said		 
.		 
The		  
federal		
prosecutor		
and		
an		
FBI		
agent		
who		
were		
interviewing		
pressed		
on		
why		
she		
waited		
five		
weeks		
to		
come		
forward		 
.		 
"		   
Honestly		 
,		 
"		
she		
said		 
,		
"		 
this		
may		
sound		
corny		 
,		
but		
I		
did		
a		
lot		
of		
praying		 
.		 
"		 
She		  
said		
she		
eventually		
came		
forward		
because		
she		
thought		
of		
her		
dad		 
,		
who		
told		
her		 
,		
"		 
you		
were		
always		
to		
speak		
the		
truth

if		
you		
know		
something		 
,		
then		
you		
are		
to		
come		
forward		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
prosecutor		
probed		
her		
account		
of		
wanting		
to		
visit		
a		
friend		 
,		
of		
sending		
her		
friend		
an		
email		
to		
tell		
her		
she		
'd		
gotten		
lost

"		  
Do		
you		
still		
have		
that		
email		 
?		  
"		 
the		
federal		
agent		
wanted		
to		
know		 
,		
and		
also		
asked		
for		
the		
friend		
's		
e-mail		
address		
and		
phone		
number		 
.		 
The		  
agents		
also		
asked		
to		
look		
at		
her		
computer		 
.		 
"		  
What		
if		
we		
looked		
at		
your		
search		
history		 
,		
were		
you		
doing		
a		
lot		
of		
reading		
about		
the		
case

looking

articles		
about		
it

She		  
acknowledged		
she		
looked		
online		
at		
articles		
to		
remember		
things		
she		
might		
have		
forgotten

After		  
a		
break		 
,		
the		
federal		
agents		
come		
back		
and		
let		
her		
know		
they		
had		
been		
through		
her		
online		
account

"

the		
news		
articles		
we		
just		
showed		
you

said		
one

"		  
I		
know		
there		
's		
so		
much		
been

on

[		 
But		 
]		
what		
you		
told		
us		
sounds		
a		
lot		
like		
what		
we		
have		
read		
in		
the		
newspaper		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
woman		
objected		 
:		
"		 
I		
have		
n't		
read		
any		
of		
that		 
,		
I		
swear		
to		
God		
on		
a		
stack		
of		
Bibles		 
.		 
I		 
looked		
at		
pictures		
to		
try		
to		
figure		
out		
which		
way		
left		
the		
neighborhood		
and		
where		
I		
was		
parked		 
.		 
"		 
One		  
of		
the		
federal		
officials		
informed		
her		
that		
investigators		
also		
pulled		
"		 
pictures		
of		
any		
cars		
that		
would		
have		
been		
going		
down		
the		
street		
when		
all		
of		
this		
happened		
that		
day		 
.		 
There		 
does		
n't		
appear		
to		
be		
any		
car		
that		
matches		
the		
description		
of		
your		
car		 
.		 
That		 
was		
another		
concern		
that		
we		
had		
as		
it		
appears		
that		
this		
car		
was		
not		
there		
at		
the		
time		
that		
this		
happened		 
.		 
"		 
At		  
one		
point		
the		
federal		
prosecutor		
said		 
:		
"		 
You		
are		
better		
off		
not		
saying		
a		
word		
and		
just		
not		
talking		
to		
us		
if		
you		
plan		
on		
lying		
and		
sitting		
in		
here		
and		
telling		
us		
lies		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
county		
prosecutors		
also		
tried		
to		
truth-squad		
her		
account		 
.		 
They		 
elicited		
from		
her		
the		
revelation		
that		
she		
did		
not		
go		
to		
the		
neighborhood		
to		
meet		
a		
friend		 
.		 
Rather		  
,		
she		
said		 
,		
she		
likes		
to		
go		
into		
a		
"		 
random		
black		
neighborhood		 
"		
to		 
,		
for		
instance		 
,		
"		 
strike		
up		
a		
conversation		
with		
an		
AfricanAmerican		
.		
.		 
.		  
because		
I		
'm		
trying		
to		
understand		
more

"		 
She		  
acknowledged		
she		
was		
"		 
bi-polar		 
"		
and		
she		
suffered		
from		
"		 
mania

"

also		
said		 
,		
"		 
I		
have		
feelings		
that		
others		
consider		
to		
be		
racist

yes

Finally		   
,		
she		
admitted		
that		
her		
recollection		
of		
Wilson		
talking		
to		
Brown		
and		
Johnson		
was		
"		 
what		
I		
read		
online		
and		
not		
what		
I		
seen

"		 
One		  
of		
the		
prosecutors		
pressed		
her
