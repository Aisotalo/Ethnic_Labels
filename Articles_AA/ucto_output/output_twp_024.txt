Obama		  
takes		
risk		
by		
weighing		
in		
on		
crisis		
while		
on		
vacation		 
When		  
President		
Barack		
Obama		
emerged		
after		
a		
night		
of		
dancing		 
,		
surf		
and		
turf		 
,		
and		
partying		
in		
Martha		
's		
Vineyard		 
,		
Massachusetts		
to		
address		
rioting		
and		
aggressive		
displays		
of		
police		
behavior		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Missouri		 
,		
he		
said		
there		
is		
no		
"		 
excuse		
for		
violence		
against		
police		 
.		  
"		 
But		 
,		
he		
added		 
,		
"		 
there		
's		
also		
no		
excuse		
for		
police		
to		
use		
excessive		
force		
against		
peaceful		
protests		 
.		 
"		 
That		  
was		
enough		
to		
anger		
a		
group		
representing		
police		
across		
the		
country		 
,		
which		
argued		
that		
Obama		
ought		
not		
weigh		
in		
on		
how		
the		
authorities		
are		
carrying		
out		
their		
legal		
duties		
more		
than		
a		
thousand		
miles		
away		 
.		 
"		   
I		
would		
contend		
that		
discussing		
police		
tactics		
from		
Martha		
's		
Vineyard		
is		
not		
helpful		
to		
ultimately		
calming		
the		
situation		 
,		 
"		
Fraternal		
Order		
of		
Police		
executive		
director		
Jim		
Pasco		
told		
the		
Capitol		
Hill		
publication		
The		
Hill		 
.		 
Pasco		  
's		
office		
said		
he		
would		
not		
be		
commenting		
further		 
.		 
But		 
his		
criticism		
highlighted		
both		
the		
risks		
Obama		
took		
in		
weighing		
in		
on		
a		
criminal		
justice		
issued		
with		
strong		
racial		
overtones		
-		
and		
the		
tricky		
optics		
of		
doing		
so		
while		
on		
vacation		
more		
than		
a		
thousand		
miles		
away		 
.		 
Obama		  
hit		
the		
links		
just		
four		
minutes		
after		
making		
his		
statement		
Thursday		 
,		
calling		
for		
peace		
and		
restraint		
following		
the		
shooting		
of		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teen		 
.		 
But		  
all		
year		
long		 
,		
he		
has		
faced		
criticism		 
,		
usually		
from		
conservatives		 
,		
for		
taking		
leisure		
time		
in		
the		
face		
of		
crisis		 
.		 
He		 
drank		
beer		
and		
played		
billiards		
with		
the		
governor		
of		
Colorado		
while		
dismissing		
calls		
to		
visit		
children		
detained		
at		
the		
border		 
.		 
He		 
enjoyed		
a		
golfing		
weekend		
in		
California		
as		
the		
Iraqi		
city		
of		
Mosul		
fell		
to		
the		
terrorist		
group		
known		
as		
the		
Islamic		
State		 
.		 
He		 
opted		
to		
continue		
with		
a		
previously		
planned		
vacation		
in		
Key		
West		 
,		
Florida		 
,		
as		
Russia		
annexed		
Crimea		 
.		 
Now		   
,		
he		
is		
vacationing		
in		
Martha		
's		
Vineyard		
as		
crises		
in		
Ukraine		 
,		
Gaza		 
,		
Iraq		
and		
Syria		
all		
crest		
anew		
-		
and		
a		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		
is		
rocked		
by		
violent		
clashes		
between		
police		
and		
protesters		 
.		 
Obama		  
is		
n't		
the		
first		
president		
to		
face		
vacation-linked		
leadership		
questions		 
.		 
His		 
predecessor		 
,		
George		
W.		
Bush		 
,		
drew		
critiques		
for		
spending		
more		
than		
a		
year		
of		
his		
presidency		
at		
his		
Texas		
ranch		 
.		 
White		  
House		
officials		
reject		
that		
brand		
of		
criticism		 
,		
noting		
that		
the		
president		
is		
always		
on		
duty		 
,		
even		
while		
he		
's		
away		
from		
the		
Oval		
Office		 
.		 
They		 
point		
out		
that		
Obama		
received		
briefings		
all		
week		
long		
on		
the		
situation		
in		
Iraq		
and		
the		
riots		
in		
Ferguson		 
.		 
On		  
Thursday		 
,		
the		
president		
made		
his		
first		
public		
comment		
on		
the		
situation		
there		
other		
than		
a		
written		
statement		
earlier		
in		
the		
week		 
.		 
He		 
called		
for		
calm		
and		
mutual		
respect		 
.		 
"		  
I		
know		
that		
emotions		
are		
raw		
right		
now		
in		
Ferguson		
and		
there		
are		
certainly		
passionate		
differences		
about		
what		
has		
happened		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
But		  
with		
his		
comment		
questioning		
whether		
the		
police		
are		
using		
excessive		
force		
against		
protests		 
,		
Obama		
stirred		
passions		
of		
his		
own		 
.		 
"		   
I		
think		
what		
he		
has		
to		
do		
as		
president		
and		
as		
a		
constitutional		
lawyer		
is		
[		 
to		 
]		
remember		
that		
there		
is		
a		
process		
in		
the		
United		
States		
and		
the		
process		
is		
being		
followed		 
,		
for		
good		
or		
for		
ill		 
,		
by		
the		
police		
and		
by		
the		
county		
and		
by		
the		
city		
and		
by		
the		
prosecutors		 
'		
office		 
,		 
"		
Pasco		 
,		
the		
Fraternal		
Order		
of		
Police		
executive		
director		 
,		
told		
The		
Hill		 
.		 
The		  
criticism		
was		
reminiscent		
of		
an		
early		
stumble		
in		
Obama		
's		
term		 
,		
when		
the		
president		
said		
a		
Cambridge		 
,		
Massachusetts		
police		
officer		
"		 
acted		
stupidly		 
"		
when		
he		
arrested		
Harvard		
professor		
Henry		
Louis		
Gates		
outside		
his		
house		 
.		 
The		 
comment		 
,		
delivered		
at		
a		
White		
House		
news		
conference		 
,		
stirred		
outrage		
in		
the		
law		
enforcement		
community		 
.		 
Obama		  
ultimately		
held		
a		
"		 
beer		
summit		 
"		
at		
the		
White		
House		
to		
smooth		
over		
relations		 
.		 
Since		  
that		
kerfuffle		 
,		
Obama		
largely		
steered		
clear		
of		
issues		
of		
race		
and		
criminal		
justice		 
.		 
In		 
his		
second		
term		 
,		
he		
has		
more		
squarely		
addressed		
the		
issues		 
,		
usually		
without		
provoking		
much		
criticism		 
.		 
He		 
addressed		
the		
nation		
after		
the		
verdict		
in		
the		
trial		
of		
George		
Zimmerman		 
,		
who		
was		
accused		
of		
killing		
Trayvon		
Martin		 
.		 
His		  
attorney		
general		 
,		
Eric		
Holder		 
,		
has		
usually		
been		
the		
one		
to		
weigh		
more		
directly		
into		
criminal		
justice		
issues		
with		
strong		
racial		
backdrops		 
.		 
On		  
Thursday		 
,		
Holder		
said		
he		
was		
"		 
deeply		
concerned		
that		
the		
deployment		
of		
military		
equipment		
and		
vehicles		
sends		
a		
conflicting		
message		 
,		 
"		
questioning		
the		
judgment		
of		
local		
authorities		 
.		 
Holder		 
briefed		
Obama		
in		
Martha		
's		
Vineyard		 
.		 
And		  
indeed		 
,		
the		
president		
has		
increasingly		
found		
support		
across		
the		
aisle		 
.		 
Republican		 
lawmakers		
also		
raised		
concern		
about		
the		
militarization		
of		
local		
police		
forces		 
.		 
On		  
policy		 
,		
Obama		
and		
the		
law		
enforcement		
community		
have		
often		
found		
themselves		
in		
step		 
.		 
Police		 
groups		
backed		
Obama		
's		
unsuccessful		
efforts		 
,		
for		
example		 
,		
to		
tighten		
gun		
controls		 
,		
often		
standing		
behind		
him		
as		
the		
president		
held		
events		
calling		
on		
Congress		
to		
act		 
.		 
Police		  
issues		 
,		
however		 
,		
have		
n't		
figured		
prominently		
during		
the		
president		
's		
term		 
,		
with		
crime		
generally		
low		 
.		 
But		  
the		
White		
House		
is		
keenly		
aware		
that		
exactly		
what		
the		
president		
has		
to		
say		
about		
law		
enforcement		
issues		
now		
-		
and		
exactly		
where		
he		
chooses		
to		
say		
it		
-		
may		
now		
be		
a		
top		
target		
for		
critics		
in		
the		
days		
ahead		 
.
