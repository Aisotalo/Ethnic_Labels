"		 
Giuliani		  
responded		
by		
citing		
a		
statistic		
from		
a		
2010		
Bureau		
of		
Justice		
Statistics		
report		
which		
did		 
,		
indeed		 
,		
conclude		
that		
93		
percent		
of		
black		
homicide		
victims		
from		
1980		
through		
2008		
were		
killed		
by

offenders		 
.

statement		
implied		
that		
intraracial		
violence		
in		
black		
communities		
is		
uniquely		
bad		 
.		 
Giuliani		 
later		
repeated		
this		
statistic		
in		
a		
FOX		
News		
interview		 
.		 
The		  
statement		
lacks		
significant		
context		 
.		 
As		  
our		
colleague		
Philip		
Bump		
noted		 
,		
Giuliani		
omitted		
the		
comparable		
statistic		
in		
the		
report		
for		
white		
homicide		
victims		 
:		
84		
percent		
of		
white		
victims		
were		
killed		
by		
white		
offenders		 
.		  
The		 
report		
found		
most		
murders		
were		
intraracial		 
,		
committed		
by		
friends		
or		
acquaintances		
of		
the		
victim		 
.		 
Stranger		 
homicides		
were		
more		
likely		
to		
be		
interracial		 
,		
with		
a		
lower		
rate		
of		
white-on-black		
murders		
than		
black-on-white		
murders		 
.		 
The		  
2013		
FBI		
Uniform		
Crime		
Report		 
,		
a		
compilation		
of		
annual		
crime		
statistics		 
,		
also		
shows		
similar		
data		 
:		
83		
percent		
of		
white		
victims		
were		
killed		
by		
white		
offenders		 
;		
90		
percent		
of		
black		
victims		
were		
killed		
by		
black		
offenders		 
;		
14		
percent		
of		
white		
victims		
were		
killed		
by		
black		
offenders		 
;		
and		
7.6		
percent		
of		
black		
victims		
were		
killed		
by		
white		
offenders		 
.		 
The		  
rate		
of		
intraracial		
homicide		
in		
the		
black		
community		
is		
the		
reason		
for		
the		
heavy		
police		
presence		 
,		
Giuliani		
said		 
,		
and		
it		
should		
be		
the		
subject		
of		
discussion		
because		
it		
's		
so		
much		
more		
prevalent		
than		
the		
shooting		
of		
a		
black		
victim		
by		
a		
white		
police		
officer		 
.		 
Dyson		  
fired		
back		 
,		
calling		
Giuliani		
's		
explanation		
"		 
false		
equivalency		 
"		
and		
that		
police		
should		
be		
held		
to		
a		
higher		
standard		 
,		
as		
they		
are		
acting		
as		
agents		
of		
the		
state		 
.		 
In		  
an		
interview		
with		
The		
Fact		
Checker		 
,		
Giuliani		
agreed		
that		
most		
murders		 
,		
black		
or		
white		 
,		
are		
intraracial		 
.		 
Asked		 
why		
he		
did		
n't		
note		
the		
other		
half		
of		
the		
statistic		
in		
his		
interview		 
,		
Giuliani		
said		
there		
"		 
are		
very		
few		 
"		
white		
intraracial		
murders		
compared		
to		
black		
intraracial		
murders		 
.		 
It		  
is		
true		
that		
the		
rate		
of		
black		
homicide		
victims		
and		
offenders		
were		
disproportionately		
represented		
compared		
to		
the		
general		
population		 
,		
the		
2011		
BJS		
report		
found		 
.		 
The		 
black		
victimization		
rate		
(		 
27.8		
per		
100,000		 
)		
was		
six		
times		
higher		
than		
the		
white		
victimization		
rate		
(		 
4.5		
per		
100,000		 
)		 
.		 
Black		 
offending		
rate		
(		 
34.4		
per		
100,000		 
)		
was		
almost		
eight		
times		
higher		
than		
whites		
(		 
4.5		
per		
100,000		 
)		 
,		
according		
to		
the		
report		 
.		 
"		   
The

Where		  
did		
he		
get		
the		
"		 
less

figure		 
?		 
Giuliani		 
said		
it		
was		
his		
estimation		
of		
the		
percentage		
of		
deadly		
force		
by		
white		
police		
officers		
on		
black		
victims		 
,		
which		
he		
described		
would		
be		
a		
small		
portion		
of		
the		
percentage		
of		
white-on-black		
murders		 
.		 
It		  
's		
impossible		
to		
accurately		
measure		
the		
rate		
of		
homicides		
by		
police		
in		
the		
United		
States		 
.		 
The		 
FBI		
maintains		
a		
limited		
database		
of		
self-reported		
and		
conservative		
estimates		 
.		 
But		 
a		
ProPublica		
analysis		
of		
federal		
data		
from		
2010		
to		
2012		
found		
young		
black		
males		
were		
21		
times		
more		
likely		
to		
be		
killed		
by		
police		
than		
their		
white		
counterparts		 
.		 
Dyson		  
told		
The		
Fact		
Checker		
that		
less		
than		
1		
percent		
is		
still		
too		
high		 
.		 
"		   
When		
you		
're		
dealing

an

the

only

if		
it		
's		
your

kin		 
,		
that		
percentage		
is

high

"		
Dyson		
said		 
.		 
Statements		  
like		
Giuliani		
's		
perpetuate		
stereotypes		
that		
criminalize		
black		
people		 
,		
he		
said		 
.		 
And		 
to		
Giuliani		
's		
point		
about		
focusing		
on		
violence		
in		
the		
black		
community		 
,		
Dyson		
said		
there		
are		
countless		
marches		
and		
rallies		
against		
violence		
within		
the		
black		
community		 
.		 
But		 
most		
do		
n't		
get		
the		
attention		
that		
events		
like		
Ferguson		
do		 
.		 
Giuliani		  
's		
statistic		
is		
rooted		
in		
Department		
of		
Justice		
studies		 
.		 
But		 
it		
lacks		
significant		
context		
-		
especially		
because		
race		
relations		
and		
police		
treatment		
of		
minorities		
are		
complex		
and		
emotionally-charged		
topics		 
.		 
We		 
also		
found		
it		
difficult		
to		
support		
Giuliani		
's		
personal		
estimation		
of		
the		
rarity		
of		
deadly		
force		
by		
white		
police		
officers		
on		
black		
victims		 
,		
but		
were		
limited		
by		
the		
unreliable		
data		
on		
homicides		
by		
police		 
.		 
Ultimately		   
,		
it		
is		
misleading		
for		
Giuliani		
to		
simplify		
this		
topic		
to		
the		
93		
percent		
statistic

then		
omit

statistic		
in

report		
for		
white		
homicide		
victims		 
:		
84		
percent		
of		
white		
victims		
were		
killed		
by		
white		
offenders		 
.		  
The		 
report		
found		
most		
murders		
were		
intraracial		 
,		
committed		
by		
friends		
or		
acquaintances		
of		
the		
victim		 
.		 
Stranger		 
homicides		
were		
more		
likely		
to		
be		
interracial		 
,		
with		
a		
lower		
rate		
of		
white-on-black		
murders		
than		
black-on-white		
murders

The		  
2013		
FBI		
Uniform		
Crime		
Report		 
,		
a		
compilation		
of		
annual		
crime		
statistics		 
,		
also		
shows		
similar		
data		 
:		
83		
percent		
of		
white		
victims		
were		
killed		
by		
white		
offenders		 
;		
90		
percent		
of		
black		
victims		
were		
killed		
by		
black		
offenders		 
;		
14		
percent		
of		
white		
victims		
were		
killed		
by		
black		
offenders		 
;		
and		
7.6		
percent		
of		
black		
victims		
were		
killed		
by		
white		
offenders		 
.		 
The		  
rate		
of		
intraracial		
homicide		
in		
the		
black		
community		
is		
the		
reason		
for		
the		
heavy		
police		
presence		 
,		
Giuliani		
said		 
,		
and		
it		
should		
be		
the		
subject		
of		
discussion		
because		
it		
's		
so		
much		
more		
prevalent		
than		
the		
shooting		
of		
a		
black		
victim		
by		
a		
white		
police		
officer		 
.		 
Dyson		  
fired		
back		 
,		
calling		
Giuliani		
's		
explanation		
"		 
false		
equivalency		 
"		
and		
that		
police		
should		
be		
held		
to		
a		
higher		
standard		 
,		
as		
they		
are		
acting		
as		
agents		
of		
the		
state		 
.		 
In		  
an		
interview		
with		
The		
Fact		
Checker		 
,		
Giuliani		
agreed		
that		
most		
murders		 
,		
black		
or		
white		 
,		
are		
intraracial		 
.		 
Asked		 
why		
he		
did		
n't		
note		
the		
other		
half		
of		
the		
statistic		
in		
his		
interview		 
,		
Giuliani		
said		
there		
"		 
are		
very		
few		 
"		
white		
intraracial		
murders		
compared		
to		
black		
intraracial		
murders		 
.		 
It		  
is		
true		
that		
the		
rate		
of		
black		
homicide		
victims		
and		
offenders		
were		
disproportionately		
represented		
compared		
to		
the		
general		
population		 
,		
the		
2011		
BJS		
report		
found		 
.		 
The		 
black		
victimization		
rate		
(		 
27.8		
per		
100,000		 
)		
was		
six		
times		
higher		
than		
the		
white		
victimization		
rate		
(		 
4.5		
per		
100,000		 
)		 
.		 
Black		 
offending		
rate		
(		 
34.4		
per		
100,000		 
)		
was		
almost		
eight		
times		
higher		
than		
whites		
(		 
4.5		
per		
100,000		 
)		 
,		
according		
to		
the		
report		 
.		 
"		   
The		
danger		
to		
a		
black		
child		
in		
America		
is		
not		
a		
white		
police		
officer		 
.		 
That		 
's		
going		
to		
happen		
less		
than		
1		
percent		
of		
the

The		 
danger

"		
Giuliani		
said		 
.		 
"		  
If		
my		
child		
was		
shot		
by		
a

I

frustrated

I

also		
be		
frustrated		
if		
my		
son		
was

by

gangster		
in		
the		
street

But		 
if		
the		
chances		
were		
-		
that		
my		
son		
would		
be		
shot		
by		
the		
gangster		
in		
the		
street

nine

I

an		
awful		
lot		
of

"		 
Where		  
did		
he		
get		
the		
"		 
less		
than		
1		
percent		 
"		
figure		 
?		 
Giuliani		 
said		
it		
was		
his		
estimation		
of		
the		
percentage		
of		
deadly		
force		
by		
white		
police		
officers		
on		
black		
victims		 
,		
which		
he		
described		
would		
be		
a		
small		
portion		
of		
the		
percentage		
of		
white-on-black		
murders		 
.		 
It		  
's		
impossible		
to		
accurately		
measure		
the		
rate		
of		
homicides		
by		
police		
in		
the		
United		
States		 
.		 
The		 
FBI		
maintains		
a		
limited		
database		
of		
self-reported		
and		
conservative		
estimates		 
.		 
But		 
a		
ProPublica		
analysis		
of		
federal		
data		
from		
2010		
to		
2012		
found		
young		
black		
males		
were		
21		
times		
more		
likely		
to		
be		
killed		
by		
police		
than		
their		
white		
counterparts		 
.		 
Dyson		  
told		
The		
Fact		
Checker		
that		
less		
than		
1		
percent		
is		
still		
too		
high		 
.		 
"		   
When		
you		
're		
dealing		
with		
an		
unjust		
situation		 
,		
the		
percentages		
do		
n't		
give		
solace		 
.		 
It		 
's		
only		
0.5		
percent		 
,		
but		
if		
it		
's		
your		
relative		 
,		
your		
kin		 
,		
that		
percentage		
is		
too		
high		 
,		 
"		
Dyson		
said		 
.		 
Statements		  
like		
Giuliani		
's		
perpetuate		
stereotypes		
that		
criminalize		
black		
people		 
,		
he		
said		 
.		 
And		 
to		
Giuliani		
's		
point		
about		
focusing		
on		
violence		
in		
the		
black		
community		 
,		
Dyson		
said		
there		
are		
countless		
marches		
and		
rallies		
against		
violence		
within		
the		
black		
community		 
.		 
But		 
most		
do		
n't		
get		
the		
attention		
that		
events		
like		
Ferguson		
do		 
.		 
Giuliani		  
's		
statistic		
is		
rooted		
in		
Department		
of		
Justice		
studies		 
.		 
But		 
it		
lacks		
significant		
context		
-		
especially		
because		
race		
relations		
and		
police		
treatment		
of		
minorities		
are		
complex		
and		
emotionally-charged		
topics		 
.		 
We		 
also		
found		
it		
difficult		
to		
support		
Giuliani		
's		
personal		
estimation		
of		
the		
rarity		
of		
deadly		
force		
by		
white		
police		
officers		
on		
black		
victims		 
,		
but		
were		
limited		
by		
the		
unreliable		
data		
on		
homicides		
by		
police		 
.		 
Ultimately		   
,		
it		
is		
misleading		
for		
Giuliani		
to		
simplify		
this		
topic		
to		
the		
93		
percent		
statistic		
and		
then		
omit		
the		
corresponding		
statistic		
for		
intraracial		
white		
murders		 
.
