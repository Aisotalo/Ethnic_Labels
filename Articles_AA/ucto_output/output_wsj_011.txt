protests		
in

across

a

initially		
stopped

's		
family		
accused		
local

teenager		 
,		
and		
the		
disclosure		
fueled		
anger		
among		
protesters

relations

both		
peaceful

violent

upsets		
me		
is		
that		
it		
should		
have

all		
over		
the		
news

,		
a		
protester		
who		
lives		
in		
St.		
Louis

had		
been		
allegedly		
involved		
in		
a

a		
robbery

asked

numerous		
media		
requests		
under

He		 
said		
it		
was		
determined		
the

could		
n't		
hold		
on		
to		
it		
any		
longer

nothing		
based

placed		
before
