In

U.S.		
District

one		
precinct		
in

has		
the		
highest		
use		
of

The		 
NYPD		
has		
n't		
selected		
a

started		
its

has		
been		
perfected		
yet

"		 
Mr.		  
de		
Blasio		
added

"		 
But		
I		
certainly		
think		
it		
's		
a		
productive		
idea

it		
will

I		
think		 
,		
ultimately		
improve		
the		
relationship		
between		
police		
and		
community

"		 
Cameras		  
often		
can		
have		
a		
role		
in		
community-police		
relations		
as		
many		
people		
witnessing		
interactions		
with		
law-enforcement		
authorities		
instinctively		
reach		
for		
their		
phones
