President		  
Barack		
Obama		
's		
response		
to		
the		
rioting		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
,		
underscores		
both		
the		
role		
he		
has		
carved		
for		
himself		
as		
uniquely		
well-suited		
to		
bridge		
the		
nation		
's		
racial		
divide		
and		
his		
discomfort		
at		
times		
with		
embracing		
the		
role		 
.		 
As		  
the		
child		
of		
a		
black		
father		
and		
white		
mother		 
,		
Mr.		
Obama		
has		
said		
he		
understands		
through		
personal		
experience		
the		
resentments		
that		
many		
in		
each		
race		
sometimes		
feel		 
.		 
At		  
times		
he		
has		
spoken		
about		
the		
black		
experience		 
,		
as		
when		
he		
said		
that		
Trayvon		
Martin		 
,		
the		
17		 
-		
year-old		
AfricanAmerican		
shot		
and		
killed		
by		
a		
Hispanic		
man		
in		
2012		 
,		
"		 
could		
have		
been		
me		
35		
years		
ago		 
.		 
"		 
But		  
Mr.		
Obama		
has		
offered		
a		
relatively		
muted		
response		
to		
the		
furor		
over		
the		
decision		
not		
to		
indict		
the		
white		
police		
officer		
who		
shot		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		
in		
Ferguson		 
.		 
The		 
White		
House		
has		
announced		
no		
plans		
to		
visit		
the		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		 
,		
a		
departure		
from		
the		
many		
other		
times		
that		
the		
president		
has		
traveled		
to		
scenes		
of		
national		
turmoil		 
.		 
Television		  
coverage		
of		
Mr.		
Obama		
's		
comments		
Monday		
evening		
added		
to		
a		
sense		
of		
his		
distance		
from		
the		
tumult		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Obama		
called		
for		
calm		
and		
told		
the		
nation		
that		
while		
many		
do		
n't		
agree		
with		
the		
outcome		 
,		
"		 
we		
need		
to		
accept		
that		
this		
decision		
was		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
to		
make

"		 
His		  
comments		 
,		
coming		
just		
after		
news		
of		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		 
,		
made		
for		
an		
odd		 
,		
split-screen		
moment		 
,		
as		
TV		
networks		
paired		
his		
appeals		
for		
peace		
with		
scenes		
of		
fires		
and		
protests		
in		
Ferguson		 
.		 
On		  
Tuesday		
in		
Chicago		 
,		
Mr.		
Obama		
adopted		
a		
firmer		
tone		 
,		
denouncing		
the		
rioting		
as		
criminal		
acts		
and		
saying		
he		
has		
no		
sympathy		
for		
those		
who		
destroy		
their		
communities		 
.		 
"		  
There		
's		
no		
excuse		
for		
it		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
The		  
president		
said		
he		
had		
asked		
Attorney		
General		
Eric		
Holder		
to		
set		
up		
a		
series		
of		
regional		
meetings		
focused		
on		
building		
trust		
between		
law		
enforcement		
and		
communities		 
.		 
Circumstances		  
in		
some		
ways		
limit		
Mr.		
Obama		
's		
ability		
to		
respond		
to		
the		
situation		 
.		 
A		 
trip		
to		
Ferguson		
could		
place		
additional		
burdens		
on		
local		
law		
enforcement		 
.		 
Officials		 
usually		
do		
n't		
want		
to		
prejudge		
the		
outcome		
of		
investigations		 
,		
and		
a		
Justice		
Department		
investigation		
of		
the		
matter		
is		
still		
under		
way		 
.		 
Marc		  
Morial		 
,		
president		
and		
chief		
executive		
officer		
of		
the		
National		
Urban		
League		 
,		
said		
the		
problems		
with		
policing		
and		
race		
relations		
laid		
bare		
by		
the		
case		
wo		
n't		
be		
solved		
with		
oratory		 
.		 
"		  
We		
should		
n't		
think		
that		
this		
is		
about		
asking		
President		
Obama		
to		
wave		
a		
wand		
and		
give		
a		
speech		
and		
heal		
the		
nation		 
,

Michael		  
Mukasey		 
,		
who		
served		
as		
attorney		
general		
under		
President		
George		
W.		
Bush		 
,		
said		
government		
officials		
need		
to		
avoid		
the		
appearance		
of		
bias		
when		
there		
is		
a		
continuing		
investigation		 
.		 
"		  
It		
certainly		
would		
be		
improper		
for		
a		
prosecutor		
to		
do		
it		 
,		
and		
it		
's		
not		
helpful		
for		
somebody		
in		
another		
branch		
to		
do		
it		 
,

Mukasey

In		  
his		
comments		
this		
week		 
,		
Mr.		
Obama		
has		
repeated		
themes		
he		
had		
adopted		 
,		
saying		
the		
nation		
had		
made		
progress		
in		
race		
relations		
but		
acknowledging		
they		
remain		
an		
issue		 
.		 
Frustrations		 
are		
n't		
about		
one		
incident		 
,		
he		
said		
Tuesday		 
:		
"		 
They		
have		
deep		
roots		
in		
many		
communities		
of		
color		
who		
have		
a		
sense		
that		
our		
laws		
are		
not		
always		
being		
enforced		
uniformly		
or		
fairly		 
.

Thomas		  
Sugrue

University		
of		
Pennsylvania		
history		
professor		 
,		
said		
Mr.		
Obama		
's		
response		
to		
the		
Ferguson		
outcome		
is		
in		
keeping		
with		
his		
stance		
in		
the		
past		 
,		
"		 
which		
is		
to		
be		
very		
cautious		
and		
to		
acknowledge		
in		
a		
deliberate		 
,		
even-handed		
way		
the		
legitimacy		
of		
feelings		
on		
both		
sides		
of		
the		
issue		 
.
