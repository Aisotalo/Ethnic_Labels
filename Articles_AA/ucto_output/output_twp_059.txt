Cornell		  
William		
Brooks		 
,		
president		
of		
the		
NAACP		 
,		
led		
the		
procession		 
,		
called		
the		
Journey		
for		
Justice		 
,		
which		
included		
local		
residents		
and		
allies		
from		
as		
far		
as		
California		
and		
North		
Carolina		 
.		 
When		 
the		
group		
reaches		
the		
home		
of		
Missouri		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		
in		
the		
state		
capital		 
,		
Brooks		
said		 
,		
he		
will		
demand		
a		
change		
in		
leadership		
of		
the		
Ferguson		
police		
department		
and		
to		
call		
for		
legislation		
to		
stop		
racial		
profiling		 
,		
require		
police		
to		
wear		
body		
cameras		
and		
reform		
the		
way		
communities		
are		
policed		 
.		 
"		   
Marches		
have		
a		
deep		
grounding		
in		
American		
history		
and		
civil		
rights		
history		 
,		 
"		
Brooks		
said		 
.		 
St.		 
Louis		
County		
Police		
controlled		
traffic		
to		
allow		
the		
marchers		
to		
walk		
in		
one		
lane		
of		
the		
streets		 
.		 
"		  
This		
march		 
,		
like		
the		
Selma		
to		
Montgomery		
march		 
,		
is		
really		
a		
pilgrimage		 
,		
predicated		
on		
prayer		
and		
a		
moral		
grounding		 
.		 
"		 
Brooks		  
noted		
that		
the		
1965		
Selma-Montgomery		
march		
was		
prompted		
by		
a		
police		
officer		
shooting		
a		
young		
black		
man		 
,		
Jimmie		
Lee		
Jackson		 
.		 
The		 
NAACP		
itself		
was		
formed		
a		
century		
ago		
in		
response		
to		
racially		
motivated		
lynchings		 
.		 
"		   
Here		
we		
are		
a		
century		
later		
trying		
to		
bring		
about		
an		
end		
to		
another		
form		
of		
racialized		
violence		 
:		
racial		
profiling		 
,		 
"		
said		
Brooks		 
,		
who		
said		
he		
considered		
the		
Brown		
case		 
,		
at		
bottom		 
,		
an		
example		
of		
racial		
profiling		 
.		 
The		 
18		 
-		
year-old		
Brown		 
,		
an		
AfricanAmerican		 
,		
was		
shot		
to		
death		
by		
a		
white		
Ferguson		
police		
officer		 
,		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
in		
August		 
.		 
On		  
Saturday		
night		 
,		
one		
of		
Wilson		
's		
attorneys		
said		
that		
the		
officer		
had		
resigned		
from		
the		
Ferguson		
Police		
Department		 
,		
the		
Associated		
Press		
reported		 
.		 
Wilson		  
,		
28		 
,		
had		
been		
on		
administrative		
leave		
since		
the		
shooting		 
.		 
Attorney		 
Neil		
Bruntrager		
said		
the		
resignation		
was		
effective		
immediately		 
.		 
Throughout		  
the		
day		 
,		
there		
was		
an		
energetic		
tide		
of		
peaceful		
protesting		
and		
organizing		
around		
the		
greater		
St.		
Louis		
area		 
.		 
At		 
midday		 
,		
demonstrators		
marched		
through		
a		
Trader		
Joe		
's		
store		
in		
a		
suburb		
south		
of		
Ferguson		 
,		
the		
Associated		
Press		
reported		 
.		 
Just		  
outside		
Ferguson		 
,		
several		
hundred		
people		
filed		
into		
Greater		
St.		
Marks		
Family		
Church		 
,		
a		
major		
meeting		
and		
coordinating		
refuge		
for		
protest		
leaders		 
.		 
The		 
afternoon		
mass		
meeting		
was		
convened		
to		
consider		
a		
set		
of		
demands		
or		
goals		
-		
a		
vital		
process		
for		
a		
maturing		
movement		
that		
aims		
to		
connect		
with		
the		
signs		
of		
solidarity		
appearing		
throughout		
the		
country		
and		
in		
foreign		
cities		 
.		 
"		   
We		
need		
to		
keep		
the		
momentum		
up		
and		
connect		
with		
the		
actions		
across		
the		
country		 
,		 
"		
said		
Derek		
Laney		 
,		
a		
local		
organizer		 
.		 
Attendees		   
,		
who		
were		
primarily		
community		
organizers		 
,		
activists		
and		
others		
who		
have		
been		
involved		
in		
the		
protests		 
,		
did		
not		
finalize		
demands		 
,		
however		 
.		 
Instead		  
,		
they		
took		
an		
informal		
vote		
on		
10		
demands		
or		
priorities		 
,		
allowing		
top		
organizers		
to		
zero		
in		
on		
areas		
that		
have		
the		
most		
support		 
.		 
Items		 
that		
enjoyed		
significant		
support		
included		
proposals		
to		
target		
policies		
that		
promote		
overly		
aggressive		
policing		
of		
minority		
communities		
and		
to		
create		
a		
national		
action		
plan		
for		
further		
protests		 
.		 
After		  
casting		
votes		 
,		
the		
meeting		
broke		
into		
smaller		
groups		
to		
discuss		
priorities		
and		
plan		
future		
actions		 
.		 
The		 
Ferguson		
protesters		
have		
maintained		
a		
decentralized		
leadership		 
,		
a		
strategy		
that		
has		
encouraged		
wide		
participation		
but		
often		
causes		
confusion		
about		
messaging		
and		
leadership		 
.		 
It		 
has		
prompted		
near-constant		
quibbling		
among		
various		
protest		
and		
activist		
groups		
who		
fall		
in		
the		
broad		
coalition		 
.		 
Organizers		  
,		
however		 
,		
remain		
loyal		
to		
the		
decentralized		
structure		
and		
have		
focused		
instead		
on		
attempts		
to		
grow		
further		
in		
numbers		 
.		 
"		   
This		
movement		
needs		
to		
grow		
indefinitely		
and		
needs		
to		
do		
so		
really		
fast		 
,		 
"		
said		
Arielle		
Klagsbrun		 
,		
a		
community		
organizer		 
,		
told		
one		
of		
the		
mass		
meeting		
small		
groups		 
.		 
Back		  
on		
Canfield		
Drive		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
before		
the		
NAACP		
march		
began		 
,		
a		
handful		
of		
residents		
marched		
around		
the		
makeshift		
Brown		
memorial		
of		
flowers		
and		
stuffed		
animals		
in		
the		
middle		
of		
the		
street		 
.		 
They		 
objected		
when		
elegantly		
dressed		
leaders		
of		
the		
Progressive		
National		
Baptist		
Convention		 
,		
who		
had		
a		
meeting		
in		
the		
area		 
,		
pulled		
up		
in		
a		
Jaguar		
and		
a		
BMW		
and		
attracted		
media		
cameras		 
.		 
"		   
Hello		 
,		
we		
're		
talking		
here		 
!		  
"		 
resident		
Copwatch		
organizer		
David		
Whitt		
shouted		
at		
the		
men		
in		
suits		
and		
hats		
and		
the		
women		
with		
jewels		 
.		 
"		  
Come		
on		 
,		
you		
all		
get		
out		
of		
here		 
.		 
Show		 
some		
respect		 
!		 
"		 
The		  
Baptist		
brass		
decamped		 
.		 
Then		  
about		
75		
bikers		
from		
area		
motorcycle		
clubs		 
,		
including		
Dem		
Boys		 
,		
pulled		
up		
to		
the		
memorial		
and		
revved		
their		
engines		
to		
much		
more		
enthusiastic		
response		
from		
residents		 
.		 
The		 
bikers		
held		
a		
4		
1/2	FRAC	 
-		 
minute		
moment		
of		
silence		 
.		 
Biker		 
leader		
Harlan		
Smith		 
,		
a		
Ferguson		
native		 
,		
said		
he		
was		
a		
former		
police		
officer		 
,		
like		
several		
of		
the		
bikers		 
.		 
He		 
said		
he		
was		
not		
taking		
sides		
in		
the		
dispute		
over		
Brown		
's		
killing		 
.		 
"		  
We		
're		
for		
peaceful		
demonstrations		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
"		  
Tearing		
up		
my		
neighborhood		
is		
not		
going		
to		
be		
accepted		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
march		
began		
after		
a		
prayer		
and		
a		
gospel		
song		
at		
the		
memorial		 
.		 
Turning		 
onto		
West		
Florissant		
Avenue		 
,		
they		
walked		
past		
volunteers		
painting		
the		
plywood		
covering		
shop		
windows		
that		
were		
smashed		
on		
Monday		
night		
after		
the		
grand		
jury		
decision		
was		
announced		 
.		 
A		 
little		
girl		
in		
pigtails		
on		
a		
porch		
called		
out		
to		
them		
with		
the		
slogan		
of		
the		
movement		 
:		
"		 
Hands		
up		 
,		
do		
n't		
shoot		 
!		 
"		 
At		  
the		
end		
of		
each		
day		 
,		
the		
marchers		
will		
be		
bused		
to		
a		
church		
in		
downtown		
St.		
Louis		 
,		
and		 
,		
later		 
,		
one		
in		
Jefferson		
City		 
,		
then		
returned		
the		
next		
day		
to		
the		
point		
where		
they		
stopped		
walking		 
.		 
Derrick		  
Copeland		 
,		
a		
chef		
from		
Kansas		
City		 
,		
Missouri		 
,		
said		
he		
took		
the		
week		
off		
work		
to		
march		
with		
his		
teenage		
nephews		 
.		 
"		  
The		
government		
and		
the		
police		
have		
robbed		
us		
of		
our		
pride

we		
still		
have		
the		
strength		
to		
march

Copeland		
said		 
.		 
"		   
It		
could		
have		
been		
me		
or		
my
