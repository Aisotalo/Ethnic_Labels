the		
Doubts		
of		
a		
Grand		
Jury		 
FERGUSON		   
,		
Mo.		
--		
It		
is		
the		
image		
that		
became		
indelible		 
,		
fueling		
protests		
nationwide		
after		
the		
confrontation		
on		
a		
muggy		
August		
day		
here		 
:		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
an		
unarmed		
18		 
-		
year-old		
AfricanAmerican		 
,		
with		
hands		
raised		
in		
surrender		
moments		
before		
a		
white		
police		
officer		
fired		
the		
shots		
that		
killed		
him		 
.		 
It		  
is		
also		
an		
image		
that		
a		
St.		
Louis		
County		
grand		
jury		
ultimately		
rejected		 
,		
concluding		
on		
Monday		
that		
it		
lacked		
probable		
cause		
to		
believe		
that		
the		
officer		 
,		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
had		
willfully		
shot		
someone		
who		
posed		
no		
threat		 
.		 
But		  
if		
the		
law		
has		
spoken		 
,		
the		
questions		
surrounding		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
final		
moments		
--		
Were		
his		
hands		
raised		 
?		 
Why		 
did		
he		
abruptly		
stop		
fleeing		
Officer		
Wilson		
and		
start		
moving		
toward		
him		 
?		 
Was		 
he		
walking		 
,		
staggering		 
,		
running		
or		
charging		
at		
the		
officer		
when		
he		
was		
shot		
dead		 
?		 
--		 
remain		
murky		
and		
unresolved		 
.		 
Those		  
questions		
may		
never		
be		
answered		 
.		 
A		  
review		
of		
thousands		
of		
pages		
of		
testimony		
from		
the		
case		 
,		
made		
public		
last		
week		 
,		
shows		
that		
the		
forensic		
evidence		
and		
some		
witnesses		 
'		
accounts		
are		
consistent		
with		
Officer		
Wilson		
's		
explanation		
of		
what		
happened		 
:		
that		
he		
shot		
Mr.		
Brown		
because		
the		
teenager		
was		
charging		
forward		
in		
a		
threatening		
way		 
,		
and		
that		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
hands		
were		
not		
raised		
to		
the		
sky		 
,		
but		
were		
at		
his		
sides		 
.		 
He		 
also		
testified		
that		
Mr.		
Brown		
had		
one		
hand		
in		
his		
waistband		 
.		 
The		  
testimony		
around		
this		
critical		
moment		
shows		
that		
the		
prosecutors		 
,		
and		
sometimes		
the		
jurors		 
,		
often		
treated		
Officer		
Wilson		
's		
account		
as		
the		
truth		 
,		
leaving		
questions		
about		
it		
unasked		 
.		 
But		  
many		
witnesses		
contested		
all		
or		
parts		
of		
the		
account		 
.		 
They		 
said		
Mr.		
Brown		
seemed		
to		
be		
trying		
to		
give		
up		
and		
was		
stumbling		
toward		
Officer		
Wilson		 
,		
perhaps		
hobbled		
by		
his		
injuries		 
,		
before		
the		
fatal		
shots		
were		
fired		 
.		 
The		  
differences		
were		
stark		 
.		 
One		 
person		
identified		
only		
as		
Witness		
10		
told		
the		
12		
jurors		 
,		
nine		
of		
them		
white		
and		
three		
black		 
,		
that		
after		
Mr.		
Brown		
turned		
to		
face		
Officer		
Wilson		 
,		
he		
went		
"		 
full		
charge		
at		
the		
officer		 
.		  
"		 
The		
witness		
said		
Mr.		
Brown		
"		 
was		
not		
in		
a		
surrendering		
motion		
of		
'		 
I		
'm		
surrendering		 
,		
putting		
my		
hands		
up		 
,		 
'		
or		
anything		 
.		 
"		 
But		  
another		
witness		 
,		
a		
resident		
of		
the		
Canfield		
Green		
apartment		
complex		
near		
where		
the		
shooting		
took		
place		 
,		
was		
adamant		
that		
the		
opposite		
had		
occurred		 
.		 
As		 
seen		
from		
her		
second-floor		
patio		 
,		
she		
said		 
,		
"		 
he		
's		
now		
facing		
the		
officer		
with		
his		
hands		
up		
like		
this		 
.		  
"		 
She		
testified		 
,		
"		 
He		
was		
casually		
walking		
as		
if		
he		
had		
got		
shot		
and		
he		
started		
feeling		
the		
pain		
or		
something		
like		
that		 
,		
where		 
,		
like		 
,		
he		
could		 
n't		 
,		
you		
know		 
,		
pick		
up		
his		
pace		
because		
of		
the		
shot		 
.		  
"		 
The		
prosecutor		
noted		
that		
the		
witness		
had		
not		
said		
in		
her		
initial		
police		
interview		
that		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
hands		
were		
up		 
,		
but		
the		
woman		
stuck		
by		
her		
account		 
.		 
The		  
shadow		
of		
doubt		
about		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
final		
moments		
may		
sustain		
a		
protest		
movement		
that		
has		
elevated		
the		
widespread		
image		
of		
his		
last		
moments		
to		
a		
symbol		
of		
injustice		 
:		
placards		
depicting		
two		
hands		 
,		
palms		
out		 
;		
hands-raised		
T-shirts		 
;		
mass		
hand-raising		
at		
demonstrations		 
;		
a		
"		 
handsup		 
"		
Twitter		
hashtag		 
;		
and		
a		
chant		
heard		
at		
protests		
here		
that		
goes		 
,		
"		 
I		
've		
got		
my		
hands		
on		
my		
head		 
,		
please		
do		
n't		
shoot

"		 
A		  
Different		
Approach		 
While		  
grand		
juries		
traditionally		
act		
as		
vehicles		
to		
gather		
evidence		
for		
indictments		 
,		
this		
one		
treated		
the		
Brown		
case		
more		
as		
an		
impartial		
inquest		 
,		
a		
move		
the		
county		
prosecutor		 
,		
Robert		
P.		
McCulloch		 
,		
has		
portrayed		
as		
an		
effort		
to		
ensure		
fairness		 
.		 
As		 
he		
made		
public		
the		
decision		
to		
handle		
the		
grand		
jury		
differently		 
,		
Mr.		
McCulloch		
was		
under		
pressure		
from		
the		
Brown		
family		
and		
its		
supporters		
to		
recuse		
himself		
because		
of		
his		
family		
's		
deep		
ties		
to		
law		
enforcement		
and		
his		
past		
dealings		
with		
police		
shootings		 
,		
and		
because		
he		
is		
the		
son		
of		
a		
police		
officer		
who		
was		
killed		 
.		 
But		 
Mr.		
McCulloch		
refused		
to		
step		
aside		 
,		
and		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		
declined		
to		
replace		
him		
with		
a		
special		
prosecutor		 
.		 
"		   
I		
do		
n't		
defend		
the		
state		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
McCulloch		
said		
in		
a		
radio		
interview		
in		
August		 
.		 
"		  
I		
do		
n't		
decide		
if		
somebody		
's		
guilty		
or		
not		
guilty		 
.		 
I		 
present		
the		
evidence		
to		
a		
jury		 
,		
and		
the		
jury		
makes		
that		
decision		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
St.		
Louis		
County		
prosecutor		
's		
office		
was		
closed		
on		
Thursday		
and		
Friday		 
.		 
Representatives		 
did		
not		
respond		
to		
email		
and		
telephone		
requests		
for		
comment		 
.		 
Some		 
legal		
experts		
say		
the		
turn		
away		
from		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
traditional		
role		
dulled		
the		
jurors		 
'		
incentive		
to		
gather		
evidence		
questioning		
Officer		
Wilson		
's		
account		
and		
implicitly		
signaled		
that		
this		
case		
was		
different		
from		
other		
criminal		
inquests		 
.		 
Others		  
noted		
that		
the		
prosecutors		
rarely		
asked		
skeptical		
questions		
of		
Officer		
Wilson		
and		
frequently		
let		
testimony		
supporting		
him		
pass		
unchallenged		 
,		
while		
boring		
in		
on		
the		
statements		
of		
witnesses		
whose		
accounts		
conflicted		
with		
the		
officer		 
's		 
.		 
"		   
It		
seemed		
the		
cross-examination		
of		
witnesses		
that		
conflicted		
with		
his		
account		
was		
much		
more		
robust		 
,		
and		
that		
there		
was		
very		
little		
cross-examination		
of		
him		 
,

Rachel

A		  
downspout		
installer		 
,		
for

,		
testified		
that		
he		
was		
sure		
he		
had		
seen		
Mr.		
Brown		
"		 
kind

you		
are

Officer		  
Wilson		
described		
the		
same		
moment		
this		
way		 
:		
"		 
I

good		
because		
I		
know

And		 
he		
had		
started		
to		
lean

going		
to		
just

"		 
The		
prosecutor		
responded		 
,		
"		 
Can		
you		
demonstrate		
for		
us		
how		
he		
was		
leaning		
forward

"		 
Some		  
experts		
questioned		
why		
Officer		
Wilson		
--		
nominally		
the		
defendant		
in		
a		
process		
aimed		
at		
determining		
his		
guilt		
or		
innocence		
--		
had		
been		
among		
the		
first		
witnesses		
to		
testify		 
,		
the		
reverse		
of		
usual		
grand-jury		
procedure		 
.		 
The		 
move		 
,		
they		
said		 
,		
might		
have		
helped		
establish		
Officer		
Wilson		
's		
testimony		
as		
the		
dominant		
narrative		
of		
the		
case		 
.		 
"		   
In		
my		
experience		 
,		
it		
's		
quite		
unusual

put		
the

Rory		
Little

a

and		
a		
criminal		
lawyer		
who		
spent		
eight		
years		
as		
a		
federal

in		
an		
interview

in

can		
compare		
what		
he		
says		
with		
everything		
else

the		
view		
that		
the		
process		
might		
have		
worked		
against		
an		
indictment

wittingly

unwittingly

is		
not		
unanimous

could

Officer

and		
both		
bruises

DNA		
evidence		
indicate

that		
Mr.		
Brown		
struck		
him		
and		
tried		
to		
wrest		
his		
gun		
away		
early		
in		
their		
encounter

Two		 
shots		
were		
fired		 
,		
and		
there		
is		
general		
agreement		
that		
Mr.

,		
wounded		
slightly		 
,		
fled

happened

be		
resolved

the

underscore		
the		
unreliability

kept		
moving		
until		
another		
volley		
killed		
him		
as		
he		
bent		
forward		 
.		 
Of		  
the		
20		
or		
so		
eyewitnesses		
who		
appeared		
before		
the		
grand		
jury		 
,		
most		
of		
those		
who		
spoke		
to		
the		
issue		
said

believed		
Mr.

his

up

some		
accounts		
were		
clearly		
not		
credible

were		
recanted

interrogation

of		
the		
credible		
witnesses		
whose		
stories		
were		
largely		
consistent

were		
at		
odds		
with		
one		
another

these		
competing		
accounts		 
,		
from		
two		
witnesses		
who		
claimed		
to		
have		
had		
clear		
views		
of		
what		
unfolded

first		 
,		
a		
passenger		
in		
a

that		
drove		
up		
during		
the		
encounter

,		
she

and		
charged		
the		
officer		
as

player

even		
as		
Officer

"

The

watched		
from		
his		
porch

Mr.		
Brown		
had		
turned

Haunting		  
Questions		 
In		  
the		
end		 
,		
at		
least		
four		
of		
the		
12		
jurors		
--		
the		
vote		
is		
secret		
by		
law		
--		
either		
believed		
that		
Officer		
Wilson		
had		
reasonably		
felt		
he		
was		
in		
serious		
danger		 
,		
or		
decided		
that		
any		
evidence		
that		
he		
had		
acted		
wrongly		
was		
too		
thin		
to		
merit		
a		
trial		 
.		 
With		 
that		 
,		
the		
legal		
system		
dispensed		
with		
what		
the		
grand		
jury		
knew		
as		
State		
of		
Missouri		
v.		
Darren		
Wilson		 
.		 
A		  
civil		
suit		
is		
possible		 
;		
lawyers		
for		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
family		
have		
said		
they		
are		
weighing		
all		
options		 
.		 
And		 
the		
Justice		
Department		
is		
conducting		
civil		
rights		
investigations		
into		
the		
shooting		
and		
the		
broader		
practices		
of		
the		
Ferguson		
Police		
Department

For		  
others		 
,		
the		
mystery		
of		
Michael		
Brown		
's		
actions		
and		
the		
questions		
around		
Darren		
Wilson		
's		
response		
are		
likely		
to		
haunt		
them		
for		
a		
long		
time		 
.		 
"		   
Do		
you		
know		
why		
Mike		
Brown		
stopped		
and		
turned		
around		 
?		  
"		 
a		
prosecutor		
asked		
Witness		
10		 
,		
who		
supported		
Officer		
Wilson		
's		
account		 
.		 
"		   
No		 
,		
I		
'm		
not		
sure

That		 
is		
something		
I		
wrestle		
with		
to		
this		
day		 
.		 
I		 
'm		
not		
sure

"		
the		
witness		
replied		 
.		 
"		  
Why		
would		
he		
turn		
around

not		
give		
himself		
up

"		 
Another		  
witness		 
,		
who		
said		
Mr.		
Brown		
should		
not		
have		
been		
shot		
so		
many		
times		 
,		
said		
she		
had		
agonized		
over		
the		
shooting		 
.		 
She		 
often		
warned		
her		
son		
to		
stay		
away		
from		
the		
area		 
,		
she		
said		 
,		
because		
it		
was		
too		
dangerous		 
.		 
"		   
It		
has		
changed		
this		
child		
's		
family		
's		
life		 
,		
everybody		
's		
life		 
,		
and		
it		
went		
from		
zero		
to		
100

"		
she		
testified		 
.		 
Later		  
,		
she		
added

"		 
It		
has		
changed		
a		
lot		
of		
lives
