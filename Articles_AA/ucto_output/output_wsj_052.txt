record

use		
of

as		
well		
as		
citizen

An		  
attorney		
for

disputed		
the		
allegations		 
,		
saying		
that		
the		
officer		
was		
never		
given		
such		
an		
order		 
,		
and		
that		
he		
had		
attempted		
to		
activate		
the		
camera		
during		
the		
shooting		
incident		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Dear		
is		
appealing		
the		
dismissal

"		  
In		
light		
of		
the		
president		
's		
remarks		
about		
body		
cameras		 
,		
he		
's		
pretty		
much		
the		
first		
casualty		
in		
the		
issue		
of		
this		
emerging		
technology		 
,

Tanner		  
Tixier

a		
spokesman		
for		
the		
police		
department

said		
the		
police		
chief		
had		
issued		
a		
special		
order		
that		
all		
interactions		
with		
citizens		
be		
recorded		 
.		 
All		 
Albuquerque		
patrol		
officers		
were		
outfitted		
with		
wearable		
cameras		
last		
fall

noted

Police		  
Chief		
Gorden		
Eden		
said		
in		
an		
emailed		
statement		 
:		
"		 
Insubordination		
tears		
at		
the		
fabric		
of		
public		
safety		 
,		
especially		
when		
the		
officer		
makes		
a		
choice		
not		
to		
follow		
a		
lawful		
order		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
Albuquerque		
Police		
Department		
has		
been		
under		
scrutiny		
for		
police		
shootings		
and		
agreed		
to		
changes		
in		
how		
it		
uses		
force		
and		
investigates		
shootings		
as		
part		
of		
a		
settlement		
with		
the		
Justice		
Department		
in		
October		 
.		 
Model		  
policies		
for		
the		
new		
technology		
recommend		
discipline		
for		
officers		
who		
fail		
to		
turn		
on		
their		
cameras		
when		
required		 
,

Michael		
White		 
,		
a		
professor		
of		
criminology		
at		
Arizona		
State		
University		
who		
wrote		
a		
Justice		
Department		
report		
about		
body		
cameras		 
.		 
Dr.		 
White		
said		
he		
believes		
officers		
will		
turn		
them		
on		
routinely		
if		
departments		
adopt		
clear		
policies		 
.		 
He		 
said		
other		
police		
departments		
will		
be		
forced		
to		
grapple		
with		
similar		
cases		
where		
cameras		
are		
n't		
turned		
on		
or		
do		
n't		
function		 
.		 
"		   
What		
Albuquerque		
is		
experiencing		
with		
this		
officer		
is		
going		
to		
play		
out		
in		
other		
departments		
across		
the		
country		
as		
more		
officers		
are		
carrying		
this		
new		
technology		 
,

Dr.		
White		
said

Dr.		  
White		
examined		
police		
departments		
that		
use

cameras

In		 
Rialto		 
,		
Calif.		 
,		
the		
number		
of		
citizen		
complaints		
against		
police		
dropped		
from		
24		
to		
3		
in		
the		
first		
year		
that		
the		
patrol		
officers		
began		
wearing		
cameras		
in		
2012		 
.		 
Use-of-force		 
incidents		
plummeted		
from		
61		
to		
25		
during		
that		
period		 
.		 
Experts		  
say		
cameras		
encourage		
better		
behavior		
on		
the		
parts		
of		
both		
police		
and		
citizens		 
,		
and		
provide		
a		
definitive		
video		
record		
of		
police-civilian		
incidents		 
.		 
There		  
have		
been		
other		
high-profile		
instances		
of		
officers		
not		
turning		
on		
cameras

One		 
officer		
involved		
in		
the		
shooting		
of		
a		
22

year-old		
black		
man		
in		
the		
small		
city		
of		
Saratoga		
Springs		 
,		
Utah		 
,		
in		
September		
did		
n't		
turn		
on		
his		
body		
camera		 
,		
said		
Owen		
Jackson		 
,		
a		
city		
spokesman		 
.		 
A		 
second		
officer		
involved		
in		
the		
incident		
had		
no		
camera		 
.		 
The		  
NAACP		
has		
called		
for		
a		
federal		
probe		
into		
the		
shooting		
of		
the		
man		 
,		
Darrien		
Hunt		 
,		
who		
was		
carrying		
a		
sword		
when		
he		
was		
confronted		
by		
police		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Jackson		
said		
the		
department		
was		
testing		
the		
cameras		
and		
did		
n't		
have		
a		
policy		
about		
their		
use		
in		
place		
at		
the		
time		 
.		 
He		 
said		
the		
officer		
was		
"		 
focused		
on		
the		
call		
and		
was		
a		
fairly		
new		
officer		 
.		 
"		 
An		  
autopsy		
commissioned		
at		
the		
behest		
of		
the		
family		
and		
seen		
by		
The		
Wall		
Street		
Journal		
showed		
that		
Mr.		
Hunt		
had		
been		
shot		
from		
behind		
several		
times		 
.		 
The		  
Utah		
County		
Attorney		
recently		
cleared		
both		
officers		
involved		
in		
the		
shooting		 
,		
finding		
that		
they		
feared		
for		
their		
lives
