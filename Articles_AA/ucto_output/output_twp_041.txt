How		
the		
rest		
of		
the		
world		
reacted		
to		
the		
Ferguson		
verdict		 
WASHINGTON		  
-		
The		
killing		
of		
Michael		
Brown		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Missouri		 
,		
by		
police		
officer		
Darren		
Wilson		
has		
made		
the		
Midwestern		
U.S.		
city		
a		
focal		
point		
for		
the		
world		
's		
media		 
.		 
It		 
shone		
a		
spotlight		
on		
what		
the		
world		
perceived		
to		
be		
America		
's		
deep		 
,		
entrenched		
problems		
-		
and		
in		
many		
cases		 
,		
made		
the		
world		
feel		
better		
about		
their		
own		 
.		 
On		  
Tuesday		 
,		
following		
the		
news		
that		
a		
grand		
jury		
would		
not		
indict		
Wilson		
for		
the		
shooting		
of		
Brown		 
,		
protests		
erupted		
in		
the		
city		 
.		 
Cars		 
were		
set		
ablaze		
and		
stores		
looted		 
.		 
Police		 
fired		
tear		
gas		
and		
protesters		
shouted		
"		 
do		
n't		
shoot		 
,		 
"		
the		
rallying		
cry		
of		
the		
protests		 
.		 
For		  
enemies		
and		
friends		
around		
the		
world		
who		
had		
been		
following		
the		
case		
for		
months		 
,		
the		
night		
was		
further		
proof		
of		
the		
maladies		
affecting		
America		 
.		 
And		 
while		
the		
shock		
of		
seeing		
scenes		
in		
America		
that		
look		
like		
they		
should		
be		
from		
the		
Arab		
Spring		
and		
the		
Ukraine		
crisis		
may		
have		
dissipated		 
,		
the		
broader		
questions		
about		
what		
this		
means		
for		
American		
society		
have		
not

British		  
news		
outlets		
covered		
the		
night		
extensively		 
:		
In		
the		
past		
few		
months		 
,		
a		
number		
had		
sent		
war		
correspondents		
to		
cover		
the		
violent		
protests		
and		
the		
militarized		
police		
response		 
.		 
"		  
Race

featuring		
a

of		
protesters		
kicking		
the		
window		
of		
a		
St.

police		
car		 
.		 
The		 
BBC		
noted		
that		
the		
violence		
seemed		
to		
be		
"		 
much		
worse		 
"		
than		
in		
August		
when		
the		
protests		
began		 
.		 
The		 
broadcaster		
also		
posted		
an		
explainer		
on		
the		
grand		
juries		 
,		
pointedly		
explaining		
why		
the		
system		
was		
"		 
controversial		 
"		
to		
readers		 
.		 
The		  
parallels		
between		
the		
Ferguson		
protests		
and

conflict

were		
highlighted		
by

At		
the		
Daily		
Mirror		 
,		
a		
British		
tabloid		
with		
a		
left-wing		
bent

one		
journalist		
says		
he		
was		
threatened		
by

the

In		  
Germany		 
,		
the		
criticism		
was		
harsher		 
.		 
The		 
conservative		
newspaper		
Frankfurter		
Allgemeine		
Zeitung		
argued		
that		
the		
underlying		
reasons		
for		
the		
violence		
in		
Ferguson		
are		
deep		
in		
American		
society		 
.		 
"

fact		
that		
racism		
exists		
in

the

"		   
Potentially

the		
fact		
that

many		
people

again		
the
