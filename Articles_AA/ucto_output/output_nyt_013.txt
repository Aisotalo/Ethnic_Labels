Activists		  
in

pointed		
to		
a		
more		
direct		
connection		
too		 
.		 
In		 
late		
2011		 
,		
the		
Persian

's		
interior		
ministry		
boasted		
that		
it		
had		
hired		
an		
American		
"		 
supercop		 
,		 
"		
John		
Timoney		 
,		
as		
an

Mr.

the		
time		
of		
his		
appointment		 
,		
American		
journalists		
noted		
that		
Mr.

been		
criticized		
for		
the

way		
officers		
infiltrated		
protest		
groups		
at		
the		
Republican		
National		
Convention		
in		
Philadelphia		
in		
2000

used		
paramilitary		
tactics
