FERGUSON		   
,		
Mo.		
--		
The		
governor		
of		
Missouri		
was		
the		
first		
person		
to		
speak		
at		
the		
news		
conference		
on		
Friday		
morning		 
.		 
But		 
as		
has		
been		
the		
case		
since		
Capt.		
Ronald		
S.		
Johnson		
of		
the		
State		
Highway		
Patrol		
first		
entered		
the		
drama		
of		
race		 
,		
violence		
and		
trust		
swirling		
in		
this		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		 
,		
the		
veteran		
trooper		
dominated		
it		 
.		 
Captain		  
Johnson		 
,		
a		
burly		
and		
plain-spoken		
Missouri		
native		 
,		
cited		
the		
Bible		 
,		
preached		
tolerance		
and		
simultaneously		
represented		
both		
law		
and		
order		
and		
the		
fear		
and		
anger		
of		
seething		
residents		 
.		 
He		 
turned		
a		
news		
conference		
into		
a		
town		
hall		
meeting		 
,		
waded		
into		
the		
crowd		
and		
seemed		
to		
listen		
as		
much		
as		
he		
spoke		
while		
he		
stood		
at		
the		
podium		 
,		
the		
governor		
by		
his		
side		 
,		
to		
discuss		
the		
fallout		
from		
the		
shooting		
death		
of		
Michael		
Brown		
by		
a		
Ferguson		
police		
officer		 
.		 
He		  
listened		
as		
resident		
after		
resident		
voiced		
angry		
and		
emotional		
concerns		
about		
law		
enforcement		
tactics		 
.		 
He		 
made		
plain		
his		
frustration		
with		
the		
local		
authorities		 
.		 
And		 
he		
pleaded		
with		
a		
city		
to		
maintain		
the		
order		
that		
on		
Thursday		
night		
allowed		
the		
air		
to		
be		
filled		
with		
honking		
horns		
and		
cigarette		
smoke		 
,		
not		
cries		
of		
pain		
and		
plumes		
of		
tear		
gas		 
.		 
"		   
We		
have		
to		
make		
sure		
that		
we		
do		
n't		
burn		
down		
our		
own		
house		 
,		
that		
we		
do		
n't		
go		
down		
there		
and		
vandalize		
our		
own		
buildings		 
,		 
"		
Captain		
Johnson		
said		 
.		 
"		  
We		
can		
stand		
on		
the		
sidewalk		
and		
we		
can		
talk		
about		
our		
issues		 
,		
we		
can		
talk		
about		
what		
we		
want		
and		
what		
we		
need		 
,		
and		
a		
conversation		
that		
needs		
to		
happen		 
,		
we		
can		
make		
that		
happen		 
.		 
What		 
I		
do		
n't		
want		
is		
us		
to		
go		
down		
and		
burn		
our		
own		
neighborhood		 
.		 
That		 
does		
not		
prove		
a		
point		 
.		 
"		 
Since		  
Captain		
Johnson		 
,		
who		
is		
black		
and		
grew		
up		
in		
the		
area		 
,		
was		
assigned		
on		
Thursday		
to		
coordinate		
security		
operations		
here		
after		
nights		
of		
violent		
unrest		 
,		
he		
has		
become		
the		
public		
face		
of		
law		
enforcement		
and		 
,		
in		
an		
unexpected		
twist		 
,		
the		
demonstrators		
being		
policed		 
.		 
Instead		  
of		
sitting		
at		
the		
command		
post		
erected		
in		
a		
shopping		
center		
parking		
lot		 
,		
he		
has		
walked		
the		
streets		 
,		
hugging		
and		
greeting		
residents		 
,		
and		
banished		
military-style		
weaponry		
in		
an		
effort		
that		
worked		 
,		
at		
least		
on		
Thursday		
night		 
,		
to		
defuse		
the		
volatile		
situation		
that		
had		
seemed		
ready		
to		
deteriorate		
even		
further		 
.		 
In		  
his		
deep		 
,		
unwavering		
voice		 
,		
Captain		
Johnson		 
,		
51		 
,		
has		
asked		
people		
to		
draw		
near		
and		
tell		
their		
stories		 
,		
and		
his		
large		
hands		
have		
clasped		
countless		
others		 
.		 
But		 
amid		
all		
of		
that		 
,		
perhaps		
what		
resonated		
most		
was		
when		 
,		
within		
hours		
of		
his		
appointment		 
,		
he		
walked		
alongside		
protesters		 
,		
including		
some		
who		
marched		
toward		
a		
convenience		
store		
that		
had		
been		
largely		
destroyed		
early		
this		
week		 
.		 
By		  
Friday		
morning		 
,		
he		
stood		
again		
at		
the		
store		
and		
invited		
residents		
to		
join		
his		
scheduled		
news		
conference		
with		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		 
,		
who		
has		
been		
criticized		
for		
his		
slow		
response		
to		
the		
turmoil		 
.		 
"		   
They		
have		
questions		 
,		
and		
they		
've		
got		
concerns		 
,		 
"		
Captain		
Johnson		
said		
after		
he		
tried		 
,		
unsuccessfully		 
,		
to		
speak		
to		
a		
man		
without		
a		
swarm		
of		
reporters		
watching		 
.		 
"		  
I		
ca		
n't		
know		
them		
if		
I		
'm		
up		
there		
and		
they		
're		
down		
here		 
.		 
"		 
And		  
so		
the		
residents		
came		 
,		
held		
back		
at		
first		
behind		
yellow		
police		
tape		
until		
Captain		
Johnson		
urged		
them		
to		
join		
the		
crowd		
near		
the		
podium		 
.		 
He		 
began		
answering		
questions		
and		
recounting		
conversations		 
,		
including		
one		
with		
his		
daughter		
after		
he		
returned		
home		
early		
Friday		 
.		 
They		 
talked		
about		
the		
story		
of		
Jesus		
Christ		
and		
an		
apostle		 
,		
Peter		 
,		
walking		
on		
water		 
.		 
"		   
She		
said		 
,		
'		 
When		
Peter		
got		
scared		 
,		
Jesus		
picked		
him		
up		
and		
said		 
,		
have		
faith		 
,		 
'		
"		
Captain		
Johnson		
said		 
.		 
"		  
And		
I		
'm		
telling		
you		
today		 
,		
we		
need		
to		
be		
just		
like		
Peter		
because		
I		
know		
we		
're		
scared		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
crowd		
cheered		 
.		 
In		  
an		
interview		 
,		
Captain		
Johnson		
said		
his		
policing		
strategy		
had		
its		
origins		
not		
far		
from		
here		 
,		
where		
he		
spent		
his		
childhood		 
.		 
"		   
I		
was		
raised		
about		
treating		
people		
with		
respect		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
"		  
I		
think		
both		
of		
my		
parents		
demanded		
that		 
.		 
They		 
did		
that		
to		
people		 
,		
so		
that		
's		
where		
it		
starts		 
.		 
I		 
grew		
up		
at		
a		
time		
where		
you		
said		
'		 
yes		 
,		
ma		 
'		 
am		 
'		
and		
'		 
yes		 
,		
sir		 
.		  
'		 
And		
I		
find		
myself		
talking		
to		
16		 
-		
year-old		
kids		
and		
17		 
-		
year-old		
kids		
and		
when		
I		
say		
'		 
yes		 
,		
ma		 
'		 
am		 
'		
and		
'		 
yes		 
,		
sir		 
,		 
'		
they		
kind		
of		
look		
at		
me		
in		
a		
strange		
way		 
,		
so		
sometimes		
I		
have		
to		
catch		
myself

"		 
Captain		  
Johnson		 
,		
whose		
uncle		
was		
a		
police		
officer		 
,		
said		
he		
admired		
law		
enforcement		
officials		
from		
an		
early		
age		 
.		 
But		 
it		
was		
in		
college		
when		 
,		
as		
a		
student		
near		
here		 
,		
a		
black		
state		
trooper		
stopped		
the		
future		
Captain		
Johnson		
for		
speeding		 
,		
and		
he		
decided		
he		
wanted		
to		
join		
the		
State		
Highway		
Patrol		 
.		 
"		  
The		
black		
trooper		
that		
stopped		
me		
looked		
so		
good		
in		
that		
uniform		 
,		
and		
had		
so		
much		
pride		 
,		 
"		
Captain		
Johnson		
recalled		 
.		 
"		  
And		
then		
I		
knew		
that		
I		
wanted		
that

The		  
captain		
and		
his		
wife

in		
the		
St.

metropolitan		
area		
and		
have		
a		
son		
and		
a		
daughter

He		  
joined		
the		
State		
Highway		
Patrol		
in		
1987

said		 
,		
and		
began		
his		
career		
in		
the		
same		
troop		
he		
now		
commands		 
,		
which		
spans		
11		
counties		
in		
eastern		
Missouri		 
.		 
He		 
was		
assigned		
for		
a		
brief		
time		
to		
a		
troop		
near		
Kansas		
City		
before		
he		
returned		
to		
this		
region		 
.		 
He		 
served		
on		
the		
agency		
's		
SWAT		
team		
and		
developed		
a		
reputation		
as		
an		
empathetic		
trooper		
who		
reached		
through		
the		
ranks		
to		
develop		
relationships		 
.		 
"		   
If		
a		
retiree		
passes		
away

about

Despite		  
the		
captain		
's		
sudden		
positive		
appearance		
in		
the		
limelight		 
,		
he		
has		
faced		
tough		
questions		 
,		
including		
some		
from		
residents		
who		
were		
frustrated		
that		
he		
was		
not		
consulted		
before		
Chief		
Thomas		
Jackson		
of		
the		
Ferguson		
police		
released		
the		
identity		
of		
the		
officer

fatally		
shot

"		   
This		
is		
all		
figurehead		
stuff

"		
one		
black		
man		
complained		
to		
Captain		
Johnson		
on		
Friday		
morning		 
.		 
The		 
captain		
stared		
straight		
toward		
the		
man		
from		
the		
podium		 
.		 
"		  
I		
can		
tell		
you		
that
