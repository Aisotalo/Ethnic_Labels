Class		  
Prejudice		
Resurgent		 
One		  
of		
the		
features		
of		
all		
the		
Ferguson		
discussion		
over		
the		
past		
few		
months		
is		
how		
tinny		
the		
comparisons		
to		
the		
civil-rights		
era		
have		
sounded		 
.		 
People		 
have		
tried		
to		
link		
Ferguson		
to		
Selma		
and		
Jim		
Crow		 
,		
but		
something		
is		
off		 
.		 
That		   
's		 
,		
in		
part		 
,		
because		
we		
've		
moved		
from		
simplicity		
to		
ambiguity		 
.		 
The		 
civil		
rights		
struggle		
was		
about		
as		
clear		
a		
conflict		
between		
right		
and		
wrong		
as		
we		
get		
in		
national		
life		 
.		 
The		 
debate		
about		
Ferguson		
elicited		
complex		
reactions		
among		
most		
sensible		
people		 
.		 
This		  
complexity		
was		
best		
expressed		
in		
the		
short		
essay		
that		
Benjamin		
Watson		 
,		
a		
New		
Orleans		
Saints		
tight		
end		 
,		
posted		
on		
Facebook		 
,		
which		
went		
viral		 
.		 
Watson		 
listed		
12		
different		
emotions		
the		
Ferguson		
mess		
aroused		 
,		
including		 
:		 
"		   
I		
'm		
ANGRY		
because		
stories		
of		
injustice		
that		
have		
been		
passed		
down		
for		
generations		
seem		
to		
be		
continuing		
before		
our		
very		
eyes		 
.		
...		 
I		 
'm		
OFFENDED		
because		
of		
the		
insulting		
comments		
I		
've		
seen		 
.		
...		 
I		 
'm		
INTROSPECTIVE		
because		
sometimes		
I		
want		
to		
take		
'		 
our		 
'		
side		
without		
looking		
at		
the		
facts		
in		
situations		
like		
these		 
.		 
"		 
But		  
the		
other		
reason		
that		
the		
civil-rights		
era		
comparisons		
were		
inapt		
is		
because		
the		
nature		
of		
racism		
has		
changed		 
.		 
There		 
has		
been		
a		
migration		
away		
from		
prejudice		
based		
on		
genetics		
to		
prejudice		
based		
on		
class		 
.		 
Let		  
me		
explain		
with		
a		
historical		
detour		 
.		 
In		 
18th-		
and		
19th-		 
century		
Britain		 
,		
there		
was		
a		
division		
between		
"		 
respectable		 
"		
society		
and		
those		
who		
lived		
in		
slums		
that		
were		
sometimes		
known		
as		
rookeries		
(		 
because		
the		
neighborhoods		
reminded		
people		
of		
rock		
faces		
where		
thieving		
crows		
lived		
in		
little		
nooks		
and		
crannies		 
)		 
.		 
The		  
people		
who		
lived		
in		
these		
slums		
were		
often		
described		
as		
more		
like		
animals		
than		
human		
beings		 
.		 
For		 
example		 
,		
in		
an		
1889		
essay		
in		
The		
Palace		
Journal		 
,		
Arthur		
Morrison		
described		 
,		
"		 
Dark		 
,		
silent		 
,		
uneasy		
shadows		
passing		
and		
crossing		
--		
human		
vermin		
in		
this		
reeking		
sink		 
,		
like		
goblin		
exhalations		
from		
all		
that		
is		
noxious		
around		 
.		 
Women		 
with		
sunken		 
,		
black-rimmed		
eyes		 
,		
whose		
pallid		
faces		
appear		
and		
vanish		
by		
the		
light		
of		
an		
occasional		
gas		
lamp		 
,		
and		
look		
so		
like		
ill-covered		
skulls		
that		
we		
start		
at		
their		
stare		 
.		 
"		 
"		   
Proper		 
"		
people		
of		
that		
era		
had		
both		
a		
disgust		
and		
fascination		
for		
those		
who		
lived		
in		
these		
untouchable		
realms		 
.		 
They		 
went		
slumming		
into		
the		
poor		
neighborhoods		 
,		
a		
sort		
of		
poverty		
tourism		
that		
is		
the		
equivalent		
of		
today		
's		
reality		
TV		
or		
the		
brawlers		
that		
appear		
on		
"		 
The		
Jerry		
Springer		
Show		 
.		 
"		 
Today		  
we		
once		
again		
have		
a		
sharp		
social		
divide		
between		
people		
who		
live		
in		
the		
"		 
respectable		 
"		
meritocracy		
and		
those		
who		
live		
beyond		
it		 
.		 
In		 
one		
world		
almost		
everybody		
you		
meet		
has		
at		
least		
been		
to		
college		 
,		
and		
people		
have		
very		
little		
contact		
with		
features		
that		
are		
sometimes		
a		
part		
of		
the		
other		
world		 
:		
prison		 
,		
meth		 
,		
payday		
loans		 
,		
a		
flowering		
of		
nonmarriage		
family		
forms		 
.		 
In		 
one		
world		 
,		
people		
assume		
they		
can		
control		
their		
destinies		 
.		 
In		 
the		
other		 
,		
some		
people		
embrace		
the		
now		
common		
motto		 
:		
"		 
It		
do		
n't		
make		
no		
difference		 
.		 
"		 
Widening		  
class		
distances		
produce		
class		
prejudice		 
,		
classism		 
.		 
This		 
is		
a		
prejudice		
based		
on		
visceral		
attitudes		
about		
competence		 
.		 
People		 
in		
the		
"		 
respectable		 
"		
class		
have		
meritocratic		
virtues		 
:		
executive		
function		 
,		
grit		 
,		
a		
capacity		
for		
delayed		
gratification		 
.		 
The		 
view		
about		
those		
in		
the		
untouchable		
world		
is		
that		
they		
are		
short		
on		
these		
things		 
.		 
They		 
are		
disorganized		 
.		 
They		 
are		
violent		
and		
scary		 
.		 
This		 
belief		
has		
some		
grains		
of		
truth		
because		
of		
childhood		
trauma		 
,		
the		
stress		
of		
poverty		
and		
other		
things		 
.		 
But		 
this		
view		
metastasizes		
into		
a		
vicious		 
,		
intellectually		
lazy		
stereotype		 
.		 
Before		 
long		 
,		
animalistic		
imagery		
is		
used		
to		
describe		
these		
human		
beings		 
.		 
This		  
class		
prejudice		
is		
applied		
to		
both		
the		
white		
and		
black		
poor		 
,		
whose		
demographic		
traits		
are		
converging		 
.		 
But		 
classism		
combines		
with		
latent		
and		
historic		
racism		
to		
create		
a		
particularly		
malicious		
brew		 
.		 
People		 
are		
now		
assigned		
a		
whole		
range		
of		
supposedly		
underclass		
traits		
based		
on		
a		
single		
glimpse		
at		
skin		
color		 
.		 
During		  
the		
civil-rights		
era		
there		
was		
always		
a		
debate		
about		
what		
was		
a		
civil-rights		
issue		
and		
what		
was		
an		
economic		
or		
social		
issue		 
.		 
Now		 
that		
distinction		
has		
been		
obliterated		 
.		 
Every		 
civil-rights		
issue		
is		
also		
an		
economic		
and		
social		
issue		 
.		 
Classism		 
intertwines		
with		
racism		 
.		 
It		  
's		
often		
said		
after		
events		
like		
Ferguson		
that		
we		
need		
a		
national		
conversation		
on		
race		 
.		 
That		 
's		
a		
bit		
true		 
.		 
We		 
all		
need		
to		
improve		
our		
capacity		
for		
sympathetic		
understanding		 
,		
our		
capacity		
to		
imaginatively		
place		
ourselves		
in		
the		
minds		
of		
other		
people		
with		
experiences		
different		
from		
our		
own		 
.		 
Conversation		 
can		
help		 
,		
though		
I		
suspect		
novels		 
,		
works		
of		
art		
and		
books		
like		
Claude		
Brown		
's		
"		 
Manchild		
in		
the		
Promised		
Land		 
"		
work		
better		 
.		 
But		   
,		
ultimately		 
,		
we		
do		
n't		
need		
a		
common		
conversation		 
;		
we		
need		
a		
common		
project		 
.		 
If		 
the		
nation		
works		
together		
to		
improve		
social		
mobility		
for		
the		
poor		
of		
all		
races		 
,		
through		
projects		
like		
President		
Obama		
's		
My		
Brother		
's		
Keeper		
initiative		 
,		
then		
social		
distance		
will		
decline		 
,		
classism		
will		
decline		
and		
racial		
prejudice		
will		
obliquely		
decline		
as		
well		 
.		 
In		  
a		
friendship		 
,		
people		
do		
n't		
sit		
around		
talking		
about		
their		
friendship		 
.		 
They		 
do		
things		
together		 
.		 
Through		 
common		
endeavor		
people		
overcome		
difference		
to		
become		
friends		 
.
