Seeks		
To		
Rebuild		
Trust		
in		
Police		 
WASHINGTON		  
--		
The		
White		
House		
on		
Monday		
defended		
federal		
programs		
that		
equip		
local		
police		
departments		
with		
military		
gear		
but		
called		
for		
new		
standards		
to		
guide		
them		 
,		
amid		
criticism		
that		
the		
programs		
"		 
militarize		 
"		
the		
police		
and		
added		
to		
tensions		
during		
the		
protests		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
President		  
Barack		
Obama		
said		
his		
administration		
would		
develop		
new		
rules		
for		
the		
programs		 
,		
adding		
that		
more		
transparency		
and		
consistency		
is		
needed		
to		
ensure		
that		
police		
use		
the		
equipment		
safely		 
.		 
The		 
president		 
,		
though		 
,		
is		
n't		
seeking		
to		
scale		
back		
the		
programs		 
,		
and		
senior		
administration		
officials		
said		
the		
focus		
was		
on		
improving		
oversight		 
.		 
"		   
We		
found		
that		
in		
many		
cases		
these		
programs		
actually		
serve		
a		
very		
useful		
purpose		 
,		 
"		
White		
House		
press		
secretary		
Josh		
Earnest		
said		 
.		 
The		  
president		
also		
asked		
lawmakers		
to		
fund		
body-worn		
cameras		
and		
other		
community		
policing		
initiatives		
at		
a		
three-year		
cost		
of		
$	CURRENCY	 
263		
million		 
.		 
Of		 
that		
amount		 
,		
$	CURRENCY	 
75		
million		
would		
be		
used		
to		
buy		
as		
many		
as		
50,000		
of		
the		
cameras		 
,		
which		
record		
police		
actions		 
.		 
Monday		  
's		
announcements		
were		
among		
the		
White		
House		
's		
first		
prescriptions		
for		
building		
trust		
between		
police		
and		
communities		
after		
the		
violent		
protests		
in		
Ferguson		 
.		 
They		 
came		
on		
a		
day		
when		
Mr.		
Obama		
spent		
much		
of		
his		
time		
grappling		
with		
the		
fallout		
of		
a		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
not		
to		
indict		
a		
white		
police		
officer		
for		
the		
fatal		
shooting		
in		
August		
of		
an		
unarmed		 
,		
black		
18		 
-		
year-old		
in		
the		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Obama		
said		
Monday		
that		
events		
in		
Ferguson		
had		
laid		
bare		
"		 
a		
simmering		
distrust		
that		
exists		
between		
too		
many		
police		
departments		
and		
too		
many		
communities		
of		
color		 
.		  
"		 
The		
steps		
announced		
Monday		
were		
aimed		
at		
ensuring		
that		
law-enforcement		
officials		
and		
the		
communities		
they		
serve		
are		
partners		
in		
battling		
crime		 
,		
the		
president		
said		 
.		 
The		  
police		
response		
to		
the		
protests		
and		
violence		
after		
the		
shooting		
drew		
attention		
to		
federal		
programs		
that		
outfit		
police		
with		
military		
gear		 
,		
with		
critics		
saying		
they		
create		
mistrust		
between		
law		
enforcement		
and		
communities		 
.		 
Supporters		 
say		
the		
programs		
provide		
useful		
equipment		
to		
police		
departments		
that		
are		
often		
strapped		
for		
funds		 
.		 
A		  
review		
ordered		
by		
Mr.		
Obama		 
,		
released		
Monday		 
,		
reported		
that		
the		
equipment		
is		
provided		
by		
five		
agencies		 
,		
which		
are		
governed		
by		
a		
variety		
of		
policies		 
.		 
Agencies		 
do		
little		
to		
coordinate		
efforts		
and		
often		
lack		
mechanisms		
to		
hold		
police		
accountable		
for		
misusing		
equipment		 
,		
the		
review		
said		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Obama		
directed		
his		
staff		
to		
draft		
an		
executive		
order		
to		
develop		
common		
standards		
for		
the		
programs		 
.		 
He		 
said		
the		
new		
standards		
would		
ensure		
that		
law		
enforcement		
agencies		
are		
n't		
building		
a		
militarized		
culture		 
.		 
The		  
president		
also		
plans		
to		
issue		
an		
executive		
order		
creating		
a		
task		
force		
on		
policing		 
,		
officials		
said
