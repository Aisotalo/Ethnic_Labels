Ferguson		  
is		
now		
a		
symbol		 
,		
not		
a		
place		 
Six		  
months		
ago		 
,		
Ferguson		 
,		
Missouri		 
,		
was		
the		
kind		
of		
nameless		
suburb		
visitors		
to		
the		
city		
of		
St.		
Louis		
passed		
through		 
.		 
That		 
was		
before		
a		
white		
police		
officer		
shot		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		
on		
a		
street		
this		
summer		
and		
months		
of		
daily		
protests		
transformed		
the		
unassuming		
city		
into		
a		
symbol		 
.		 
Ferguson		  
is		
now		
a		
word		
that		
evokes		
feelings		 
.		 
Though		  
it		
has		
been		
less		
than		
four		
months		
since		
Michael		
Brown		
was		
killed		 
,		
the		
town		
seems		
to		
have		
entered		
the		
pantheon		
of		
places		
that		
stand		
as		
metaphors		 
.		 
Ferguson		 
's		
symbolism		
now		
sits		
alongside		
Selma		
's		
significance		
in		
the		
civil		
rights		
movement		 
,		
Columbine		
as		
a		
symbol		
of		
teenage		
rage		
and		
gun		
violence		 
,		
and		
Kent		
State		
's		
historic		
link		
to		
anti-war		
protests		 
.		 
Those		 
are		
places		
that		
have		
adjusted		
-		
some		
more		
smoothly		
than		
others		
-		
to		
their		
emblematic		
meaning		 
.		 
In		  
Ferguson		 
,		
dozens		
of		
buildings		
and		
vehicles		
burned		
Monday		
night		
after		
the		
announcement		
of		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
not		
to		
indict		
officer		
Darren		
Wilson		
in		
Brown		
's		
killing		 
.		 
It		 
is		
impossible		
to		
imagine		
that		
the		
town		
will		
ever		
be		
the		
same		 
.		 
And		 
people		
who		
knew		
the		
Ferguson		
of		
old		
are		
grappling		
with		
the		
change		 
.		 
Throngs		  
of		
reporters		 
,		
representing		
more		
than		
100		
media		
organizations		
at		
the		
height		
of		
the		
news		
story		 
,		
traveled		
to		
the		
town		
to		
cover		
the		
protests		
-		
some		
peaceful		 
,		
others		
with		
flashes		
of		
violence		 
.		 
Since		 
August		 
,		
activists		
from		
across		
the		
country		
descended		
as		
well		
to		
help		
shape		
a		
movement		
addressing		
the		
relationship		
between		
law		
enforcement		
and		
the		
black		
community		 
.		 
The		 
unrest		
in		
the		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		
even		
drew		
the		
president		
to		
the		
White		
House		
press		
briefing		
room		
this		
week		
to		
make		
a		
statement		 
.		 
"		  
This

said

it

talking

Previously

Ferguson		
"		 
tried		
to		
brand		
itself		
as		
having		
a		
main		
street

it

very		
little

---		   
In		  
April		
1999		 
,		
the		
tragedy		
that		
dominated		
national		
headlines		
was		
the		
shootings		
near		
the		
city		
of		
Littleton		 
,		
Colo.		 
,		
at		
Columbine		
High

where		
two		
students		
murdered		
12		
classmates		
and		
one		
teacher

In		 
the		
immediate		
aftermath

the		
horrific		
massacre		
became		
known		
alternately		
as		
the		
"		 
Littleton		
killings		 
"		
and		
the		
"		 
Columbine		
killings		 
.

The

over

In		  
the

,		
Michael

being		
subsumed		
by

focusing

on		
the		
fraught

The		 
place		
and		
the

have		
become		
more		
dominant		
in		
many		
ways		
than		
the		
name

who		
died

Earlier		  
this		
week		 
,		
Cullen

who		
lives

New

could		
n't		
immediately		
recall		
Brown		
's		
last		
name		 
,

he		
was		
completely		
familiar		
with		
the		
narrative		
of		
Ferguson

which		
to		
him		
has		
come		
to		
signify		
protest		
against		
over-policing		
of		
black		
communities

who		
covered		
the		
news		
of		
the		
shootings		
at		
Columbine		
High

later		
studied		
what		
happened		
there		 
,		
watched		
as		
the		
word		
"

also		
became		
a		
shorthand

its		
case

The

Cullen

They		
found		
it		
really		
horrifying

"		 
Four		  
months		
after		
the		
shooting

the

school

held		
an		
elaborate		
ceremony

they		
called		
a		
"

"		
rally

It		 
was		
the		
first		
day		
of		
a		
new		
school		
year

Parents		 
and		
other		
community		
members		
formed		
a		
human		
shield		
surrounding		
the		
school		
to		
keep		
members

out

Still

"		 
Columbine		
is

name

the		
public

for		
the		
primary		
survivors

it		
was		
powerful

"		
Cullen		
said

The		  
Littleton		
community		
decided		
to		
keep		
the		
school		
open

The		 
library

A

opposition

the

deaths		
inspired

to

"		 
The		  
deaths		
at

brought		
on		
a		
fresh		
wave

anti-war		
activism

college		
campuses		
across		
the		
country

Forty-four		 
years		
later

the		
words		
Kent

still		
bring

mind

the		
students		
who		
died		
on		
the		
university		
campus

Both

those		
who		
care		
about		
the		
months-long		
protest		
movement		
there		
can		
hope		
for		
a		
respectable		
end

There		 
is		
still		
time		
to		
shape		
the		
full		
meaning		
of		
Ferguson

Think		  
about		
Selma		 
,		
a		
small		
town		
in		
Alabama		
that		
was		
central		
to		
the		
cause		
of		
non-violent		
civil		
rights		
protesters		
in		
the		
1960		 
s		 
.		 
The		 
town		
is		
so		
linked		
with		
the		
movement		
that		
a		
movie		
coming		
to		
theaters		
in		
December		
is		
simply		
titled		
"		 
Selma		 
.		  
"		 
The		
film		
tells		
the		
story		
of		
the		
Selma-to-Montgomery		
marches		 
,		
led		
by		
Martin		
Luther		
King		
Jr.		
They		
were		
critical		
to		
the		
future		
of		
the		
civil		
rights		
movement		
and		
came		
to		
define		
the		
place		 
.		 
The		  
resistance		
to		
civil		
rights		
was		
once		
Selma		
's		
shame		 
.		 
Now		 
it		
is		
home		
to		
museums		
and		
memorials		
chronicling		
the		
1960		 
s		
movement		
for		
racial		
equality		 
.		 
It		  
's		
possible		
that		
Ferguson		
could		
someday		
experience		
a		
transformation		
like		
Selma		 
's		 
.		 
But		  
whatever		
happens		 
,		
it		
ca		
n't		
go		
back		
to		
being		
a		
forgettable		
St.		
Louis		
suburb
