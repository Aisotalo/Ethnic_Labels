Authorities		
in		
this		
restive		
suburb		
of		
St.		
Louis		
on		
Friday		
began		
telling		
their		
version		
of		
the		
events		
surrounding		
the		
fatal		
shooting		
of		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		
by		
a		
white		
police		
officer		 
,		
but		
the		
halting		 
,		
contradictory		
nature		
of		
the		
account		
revived		
popular		
anger		
here		
and		
brought		
criticism		
from		
other		
law		
enforcement		
agencies		 
.		 
Nearly		  
a		
week		
after		
18		 
-		
year-old		
Michael		
Brown		
's		
death		
sparked		
days		
of		
protests		 
,		
police		
identified		
the		
officer		
who		
killed		
him		
as		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
who		
has		
six		
years		
of		
service		
with		
no		
disciplinary		
record		 
.		 
But		 
they		
provided		
virtually		
no		
information		
about		
the		
officer		 
,		
instead		
focusing		
on		
linking		
Brown		
to		
a		
convenience		
store		
robbery		
that		
occurred		
just		
before		
the		
shooting		 
.		 
At		  
a		
tense		
early-morning		
news		
conference		 
,		
Ferguson		
Police		
Chief		
Thomas		
Jackson		
said		
Brown		
had		
been		
the		
prime		
suspect		
in		
that		
robbery		
-		
in		
which		
several		
boxes		
of		
cigars		
were		
stolen		
-		
and		
that		
his		
description		
was		
broadcast		
over		
police		
frequencies		
just		
before		
his		
encounter		
with		
Wilson		 
.		 
Police		 
dramatized		
the		
allegation		 
,		
releasing		
security		
camera		
photos		
showing		
a		
person		
they		
identified		
as		
Brown		
towering		
over		
and		
menacing		
the		
store		
clerk		 
,		
images		
that		
were		
circulated		
nationwide		 
.		 
Yet		   
,		
despite		
the		
implication		
that		
Brown		
had		
been		
stopped		
because		
of		
the		
robbery		 
,		
Jackson		
later		
appeared		
to		
reverse		
himself		 
,		
saying		
at		
a		
second		
news		
conference		
that		
the		
confrontation		
"		 
was		
not		
related		
to		
the		
robbery		 
"		
at		
all		 
.		 
Instead		  
,		
he		
said		 
,		
Brown		
was		
stopped		
because		
he		
and		
a		
friend		
were		
walking		
in		
the		
street		 
.		 
Hours		  
later		 
,		
Jackson		
returned		
again		
to		
the		
robbery		
theme		 
,		
telling		
the		
St.		
Louis		
Post-Dispatch		
that		
the		
officer		
saw		
cigars		
in		
Brown		
's		
hand		
and		
realized		
he		
might		
be		
the		
robber		 
.		 
The		  
confusion		
not		
only		
did		
little		
to		
calm		
tensions		
roiling		
this		
community		
of		
21,000		
but		
appeared		
to		
further		
inflame		
them		 
.		 
Scattered		 
protests		
continued		 
,		
and		
the		
police		
actions		
drew		
a		
rebuke		
from		
Brown		
's		
family		 
,		
which		
accused		
Jackson		
of		
deliberately		
besmirching		
the		
teen		
's		
character		 
.		 
"		   
The		
family		
feels		
that		
was		
strategic		 
,		 
"		
Anthony		
Gray		 
,		
a		
lawyer		
for		
Brown		
's		
family		 
,		
said		
during		
a		
news		
conference		
Friday		 
.		 
"		  
They		
feel		
it		
was		
aimed		
at		
denigrating		
their		
son		 
.		 
It		 
was		
an		
attempt		
at		
character		
assassination		 
.		 
"		 
Added		  
Eric		
Davis		 
,		
a		
cousin		
of		
Brown		
's		
mother		 
:		
"		 
It		
infuriated		
us		 
.		 
"		 
There		  
were		
also		
signs		
Friday		
of		
a		
rift		
among		
state		
and		
local		
authorities		
involved		
in		
the		
case		 
,		
only		
one		
day		
after		
political		
and		
community		
leaders		
mounted		
a		
renewed		
effort		
to		
tamp		
down		
the		
violence		
and		
find		
ways		
to		
prevent		
future		
outbreaks		
while		
multiple		
investigations		
of		
the		
shooting		
proceed		 
.		 
In		  
an		
unusual		
public		
disagreement		 
,		
the		
law		
enforcement		
official		
newly		
in		
charge		
of		
security		
in		
Ferguson		
appeared		
to		
question		
the		
decision		
to		
name		
Brown		
as		
a		
robbery		
suspect		 
.		 
"		  
I		
would		
have		
liked		
to		
have		
been		
consulted		 
,		 
"		
Missouri		
State		
Highway		
Patrol		
Capt.		
Ronald		
Johnson		
said		
Friday		 
,		
adding		
that		
he		
would		
meet		
with		
Jackson		
to		
discuss		
"		 
how		
that		
was		
released		 
.		 
"		 
Johnson		   
,		
an		
AfricanAmerican		
who		
grew		
up		
in		
the		
Ferguson		
area		 
,		
had		
been		
put		
in		
charge		
on		
Thursday		
by		
Missouri		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		
when		
the		
governor		
announced		
that		
the		
state		
highway		
patrol		
would		
take		
over		
security		
operations		
after		
days		
of		
images		
of		
riot		
police		
and		
tear		
gas		
in		
the		
streets		 
.		 
Law		  
enforcement		
officials		
typically		
strive		
to		
present		
a		
united		
front		 
,		
yet		
Nixon		
's		
decision		
prompted		
an		
unusual		
public		
attack		
from		
St.		
Louis		
County		
Prosecuting		
Attorney		
Robert		
McCulloch		 
,		
who		
was		
angered		
that		
the		
move		
would		
take		
control		
of		
the		
scene		
away		
from		
St.		
Louis		
County		
police		 
.		 
"		  
For		
Nixon		
to		
never		
talk		
to		
the		
commanders		
in		
the		
field		
and		
come		
in		
here		
and		
take		
this		
action		
is		
disgraceful		 
,		 
"		
McCulloch		
told		
the		
St.		
Louis		
Post-Dispatch		 
.		 
"		  
It		
's		
shameful		
what		
he		
did		 
.		 
"		 
St.		  
Louis		
County		
Executive		
Charlie		
Dooley		
later		
said		
he		
is		
leading		
an		
effort		
to		
remove		
the		
county		
prosecutor		
from		
the		
investigation		
because		
of		
bias		 
.		 
McCulloch		 
is		
the		
person		
who		
will		
decide		
whether		
state		
charges		
will		
be		
filed		
against		
the		
police		
officer		 
.		 
It		  
was		
not		
clear		
Friday		
whether		
the		
evident		
turf		
battles		
would		
hamper		
the		
state		
investigation		
of		
Brown		
's		
shooting		 
.		 
The		 
Justice		
Department		
and		
FBI		 
,		
which		
are		
conducting		
a		
parallel		
investigation		
to		
determine		
whether		
Brown		
's		
civil		
rights		
were		
violated		 
,		
are		
deferring		
for		
now		
to		
state		
investigators		
but		
are		
also		
monitoring		
them		 
.		 
The		  
announcements		
from		
police		
identifying		
the		
officer		
and		
naming		
Brown		
as		
a		
robbery		
suspect		
came		
after		
the		
calmest		
night		
in		
Ferguson		
since		
Brown		
was		
killed		 
.		 
His		 
death		
has		
sparked		
outrage		
and		
protests		 
,		
with		
hundreds		
marching		
in		
the		
streets		
in		
the		
days		
that		
followed		 
.		 
Little		  
information		
about		
the		
shooting		
has		
been		
publicly		
released		 
,		
and		
the		
media		
frenzy		
to		
learn		
more		
about		
Wilson		
yielded		
only		
scattered		
bits		
of		
information		 
.		 
According		  
to		
public		
records		 
,		
Wilson		 
,		
28		 
,		
was		
an		
honor		
roll		
student		
at		
St.		
Charles		
High		
School		
near		
Ferguson		
in		
the		
ninth		
and		
10th		
grades		 
.		 
His		 
mother		
died		
when		
he		
was		
16		 
.		 
The		  
officer		 
,		
who		
has		
been		
placed		
on		
administrative		
leave		 
,		
a		
few		
days		
ago		
left		
his		
neighborhood		
in		
Crestwood		 
,		
a		
city		
of		
11,000		
people		
about		
18		
miles		
southwest		
of		
Ferguson		 
.		 
Dark		 
blue		
undercover		
police		
cars		
were		
parked		
outside		
his		
house		
on		
Manda		
Lane		 
,		
with		
a		
marked		
police		
car		
in		
the		
parking		
lot		
of		
a		
church		
to		
the		
rear		
of		
the		
house		 
.		 
Most		  
people		
in		
the		
neighborhood		
of		
brick		
ranch		
houses		
and		
manicured		
lawns		
declined		
to		
comment

A		 
sign		
on		
the		
door		
of		
a		
neighbor		
next		
to

Jackson		   
,		
the		
police		
chief		 
,		
described		
Wilson		
as		
"		 
a		
gentle

quiet		
man

The		  
sequence		
of		
events		
in		
Brown		
's		
shooting		
is		
still		
unclear		 
.		 
According		 
to		
a		
friend		
who		
says		
he		
witnessed		
the		
encounter		 
,		
Brown		
was		
walking		
along		
a		
Ferguson		
street		
when		
a		
police		
officer		
in		
a		
car		
ordered		
him		
to		
get		
on		
the		
sidewalk		 
.		 
Brown		 
had		
his		
hands		
in		
the		
air		
to		
show		
he		
was		
unarmed		
when		
the		
officer		
shot		
him		
multiple		
times		 
,		
the		
friend		
said		 
.		 
The		  
police		
version		
is		
that		
Brown		
attacked		
the		
officer		
in		
his		
car		
and		
tried		
to		
grab		
his		
gun		 
.		 
Police		  
gave		
far		
more		
detail		
Friday		
about		
the		
robbery		
at		
the		
convenience		
store		 
,		
handing		
out		
a		
19		 
-		 
page		
packet		
of		
documents		 
.		 
According		  
to		
the		
documents		 
,		
Ferguson		
police		
officers		
received		
a		
call		
at		
11:51	TIME	
a.m.		
Saturday		
about		
a		
robbery		
in		
progress		
at		
the

black		
male		
in		
a

T-shirt		
walking		
north		
toward

I		
did		
not		
see		
the

an		
unnamed		
officer		
wrote		
in		
the		
report		 
.		 
The		  
officer		
wrote		
that		
the		
store		
clerk		
described		
the		
suspect		
as

khaki		
shorts

yellow		
socks		
and		
a

The

was		
also		
told		
that		
another

male		
was		
with

A

redacted		
witness		
report		
in		
the		
packet		
-		
which		
did		
not		
state		
who		
provided

a

inside		
the		
store		
came		
out		
of		
the		
bathroom		
during		
the		
altercation

She		  
told

from		
leaving		
the		
store		
by		
standing		
in
