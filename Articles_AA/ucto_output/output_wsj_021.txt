A

Mr.

43		
years

,		
apparently		
resisting

before		
a		
police		
officer		
used		
an		
apparent		
chokehold		
to		
subdue		
him		
--		
a		
move		
banned		
by		
the		
NYPD		 
.		 
Police

said		
Mr.

Tensions		  
between		
police		
and		
community		
have		
intensified		
in		
recent		
weeks		 
,		
as		
Mr.		
Garner		
's		
case		
has		
been		
compared		
by		
some		
with		
the		
fatal		
shooting		
by		
a		
police		
officer		
of		
unarmed		
teenager		
Michael		
Brown		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
It		  
is		
the		
second		
high-profile		
meeting		
of		
community		
leaders		
Mr.		
de		
Blasio		
has		
convened		
since		
Mr.		
Garner		
's		
death		 
.		 
Late		  
last		
month		 
,		
the		
mayor		
hosted		
a		
roundtable		
with		
Messrs.		
Bratton		
and		
Sharpton		
and		
other		
elected		
officials		 
.		 
The		 
meeting		
was		
controversial		
because		
Mr.		
Sharpton		
criticized		
Mr.		
Bratton		
's		
policies		 
.		 
It		  
was		
n't		
clear		
Tuesday		
evening		
whether		
Mr.		
Sharpton		
planned		
to		
attend		
on		
Wednesday		 
.		 
A		 
spokeswoman		
did		
n't		
respond		
to		
requests		
for		
comment		 
.		 
The		  
roundtable		
will		
be		
closed		
to		
the		
media

the		
mayor		 
,		
Cardinal		
Dolan		
and		
others		
plan		
to		
hold		
news		
conference		
afterward
