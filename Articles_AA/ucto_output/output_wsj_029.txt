I		
understand		
that		
mistrust		 
.		 
I		 
am		
the		
attorney

United		
States		 
.		 
But		 
I		
am		
also		
a		
black		
man

"		
he		
said		 
,		
recounting		
instances		
earlier		
in		
his		
life

"		 
The		
eyes		
of		
the		
nation		
and		
the		
world		
are		
watching		
Ferguson		
right		
now		 
.		 
The		 
world		
is		
watching		
because		
the		
issues		
raised		
by		
the		
shooting		
of		
Michael		
Brown		
predate		
this		
incident		 
.		 
This		 
is		
something		
that		
has		
a		
history		
to		
it		
and		
the		
history		
simmers		
beneath		
the		
surface		
in		
more		
communities		
than		
just		
Ferguson		 
.		 
"		 
Mr.		  
Holder		
spoke		
for		
about		
15		
minutes		
before		
taking		
questions		
from		
the		
audience		 
.		 
It		  
is		
unusual		
for		
the		
nation		
's		
top		
law-enforcement		
official		
to		
personally		
travel		
to		
show		
his		
involvement		
in		
the		
early		
days		
of		
an		
investigation		 
.		 
Justice		 
Department		
officials		
have		
voiced		
concerns		
about		
the		
clashes		
between

and		
sought		
to		
calm		
tensions		
by		
taking		
aggressive		
investigative		
steps		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Holder		
has		
criticized

made		
by		
local		
authorities		
in		
response		
to		
the		
Brown		
shooting		 
.		 
Justice		 
Department		
officials

practice		 
"		 
"		
investigation		
of

Ferguson		
Police		
Department

about		
53

of		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
the		
28		 
-		
year-old		
officer		
who		
shot		
Mr.		
Brown		 
.		 
Launching		 
an		
additional		
pattern		
and		
practice		
investigation		
would		
expand		
federal		
involvement		
and		
could		
complicate		
the		
shooting		
probe		 
.
