A		  
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
to		
reject		
charges		
against		
a		
white		
officer		
in		
the		
shooting		
death		
of		
a		
black		
teenager		
in		
Missouri		
likely		
wo		
n't		
be		
the		
last		
word		
from		
the		
courts		
on		
the		
tragic		
events		
of		
Aug.		
9		 
.		 
For		  
starters		 
,		
the		
Justice		
Department		
is		
conducting		
its		
own		
criminal		
investigation		
to		
see		
if		
federal		
civil-rights		
laws		
were		
violated		
by		
Ferguson		
Officer		
Darren		
Wilson		
in		
the		
killing		
of		
18		 
-		 
year		
old		
Michael		
Brown		
after		
an		
altercation		
between		
the		
two		 
,		
an		
incident		
that		
sparked		
waves		
of		
protests		
and		
a		
national		
outcry		 
.		 
While		  
the		
known		
facts		
of		
the		
case		
suggest		
it		
would		
be		
difficult		
to		
bring		
such		
charges		
against		
the		
officer		 
,		
that		
review		
probably		
will		
take		
weeks		
or		
months		
more		 
,		
according		
to		
people		
familiar		
with		
the		
work		 
.		 
Any		  
federal		
charge		
would		
have		
to		
show		
that		
Mr.		
Wilson		 
,		
28		 
,		
intended		
to		
violate		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
civil		
rights		 
.		 
Some		  
of		
the		
evidence		
gathered		
by		
the		
Federal		
Bureau		
of		
Investigation		
was		
presented		
to		
the		
local		 
,		
12		 
-		 
member		
grand		
jury		
whose		
finding		
was		
announced		
Monday		
night		 
,		
according		
to		
people		
close		
to		
the		
case		 
.		 
That		  
grand-jury		
process		
had		
been		
touched		
by		
controversy		 
.		 
St.		  
Louis		
County		
Prosecuting		
Attorney		
Robert		
McCulloch		
faced		
calls		
to		
step		
aside		
in		
favor		
of		
a		
special		
prosecutor		
for		
various		
reasons		 
,		
including		
the		
fact		
his		
father		
was		
a		
St.		
Louis		
police		
officer		
who		
was		
killed		
by		
an		
armed		
suspect		
50		
years		
ago		 
.		 
That		  
was		
followed		
by		
alleged		
leaks		
from		
those		
involved		
in		
the		
process		 
.		 
Separately		   
,		
the		
Justice		
Department		
has		
opened		
a		
civil		
investigation		
aimed		
at		
the		
entire		 
,		
53		 
-		 
member		
police		
force		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
which		
is		
a		
suburb		
of		
St.		
Louis		 
.		 
The		  
probe		 
,		
which		
is		
exploring		
whether		
Ferguson		
police		
engaged		
in		
a		
"		 
pattern		
and		
practice		 
"		
of		
legal		
violations		 
,		
will		
focus		
on		
possible		
excessive		
use		
of		
force		 
,		
statistics		
on		
stops		 
,		
searches		
and		
arrests		 
,		
as		
well		
as		
treatment		
of		
prisoners		
and		
discriminatory		
policing		 
,		
Justice		
Department		
officials		
said		 
.		 
The		  
force		
in		
the		
majority-black		
city		
only		
employs		
a		
handful		
of		
minority		
members		 
.		 
Legal		  
experts		
said		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
family		
also		
could		
choose		
to		
file		
a		
lawsuit		 
.		 
The		  
claim		
in		
any		
civil		
suit		
most		
likely		
would		
be		
lodged		
under		
the		
so-called		
"		 
1983		 
"		
provision		
in		
federal		
civil-rights		
statutes		 
.		 
Such		 
a		
claim		
probably		
would		
allege		
that		
Mr.		
Wilson		 
,		
while		
working		
as		
an		
officer		
"		 
under		
color		
of		
state		
law		 
,		 
"		
deprived		
Mr.		
Brown		
of		
his		
constitutionally		
protected		
rights		 
.		 
As		  
a		
civil		
claim		 
,		
the		
Brown		
family		
would		
n't		
have		
to		
prove		
its		
case		
"		 
beyond		
a		
reasonable		
doubt		 
,		 
"		
the		
standard		
of		
proof		
used		
in		
criminal		
cases		 
.		 
Rather		   
,		
the		
family		
would		
have		
to		
show		
that		
Mr.		
Wilson		
more		
likely		
than		
not		
violated		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
rights		 
.		 
If		  
found		
liable		 
,		
Mr.		
Wilson		
probably		
would		
have		
to		
pay		
financial		
damages		
to		
the		
Brown		
family		 
,		
which		
has		
hired		
prominent		
civil-rights		
attorney		
Benjamin		
Crump		 
.		 
The		  
city		
of		
Ferguson		
also		
will		
conduct		
its		
own		
investigation		
into		
Mr.		
Wilson		
's		
actions		
in		
the		
shooting		 
.		 
The		  
facts		
considered		
in		
grand-jury		
deliberations		
typically		
are		
kept		
secret		 
,		
largely		
to		
allow		
witnesses		
the		
opportunity		
to		
testify		
without		
fear		
of		
reprisal		 
.		 
Moreover		   
,		
grand		
jurors		
typically		
swear		
before		
a		
judge		
not		
to		
discuss		
the		
proceedings		 
,		
and		
never		
to		
divulge		
--		
even		
to		
family		
members		
--		
how		
and		
why		
they		
voted		 
.		 
But		  
Mr.		
McCulloch		 
,		
in		
announcing		
the		
decision		
Monday		
night		 
,		
said		
evidence		
would		
be		
released		
to		
the		
public		 
.		 
That		 
decision		
could		
make		
it		
far		
easier		
to		
bring		
--		
and		
win		
--		
other		
lawsuits		
based		
on		
the		
shooting		
or		
any		
other		
legal		
case		
arising		
out		
of		
the		
incident		 
.		 
Prosecutors		  
will		 
,		
occasionally		 
,		
try		
again		
for		
an		
indictment		
with		
a		
different		
grand		
jury		 
,		
especially		
if		
they		
unearth		
new		
evidence		
or		
a		
new		
witness		 
.		 
Legal		 
experts		 
,		
however		 
,		
do		
n't		
anticipate		
a		
do-over		
in		
regard		
to		
Mr.		
Wilson		 
.
