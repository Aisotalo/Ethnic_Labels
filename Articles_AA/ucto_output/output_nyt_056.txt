LOUIS		 
--		
At		
colleges		
and		
high		
schools		 
,		
outside		
police		
stations		 
,		
courthouses		 
,		
city		
halls		
and		
federal		
buildings		 
,		
a		
series		
of		
nationwide		
protests		
on		
Monday		
maintained		
the		
momentum		
of		
those		
seeking		
justice		
for		
the		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		
who		
was		
killed		
by		
a		
white		
police		
officer		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
,		
almost		
four		
months		
ago		 
.		 
At		  
gatherings		
from		
New		
England		
to		
California		 
,		
most		
of		
them		
peaceful		 
,		
people		
walked		
out		
of		
their		
jobs		
and		
classrooms		
with		
their		
hands		
raised		 
,		
the		
gesture		
that		
has		
become		
a		
symbol		
for		
the		
death		
of		
Michael		
Brown		 
.		 
At		 
many		 
,		
the		
names		
of		
Mr.		
Brown		
and		
other		
AfricanAmerican		
killed		
by		
law		
enforcement		
officers		
were		
read		
aloud		 
.		 
In		 
some		
places		 
,		
protesters		
sat		
in		
silence		
for		
four		
and		
a		
half		
minutes		 
,		
representing		
the		
roughly		
four		
and		
a		
half		
hours		
that		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
body		
lay		
on		
a		
Ferguson		
street		
after		
the		
Aug.		
9		
shooting		 
.		 
The		  
protests		
came		
a		
week		
after		
St.		
Louis		
County		
prosecutors		
announced		
that		
a		
grand		
jury		
had		
declined		
to		
indict		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
the		
officer		
who		
shot		
Mr.		
Brown		 
.		 
That		 
decision		
set		
off		
a		
wave		
of		
anger		 
,		
including		
arson		
and		
looting		
in		
Ferguson		 
.		 
In		  
New		
York		
City		 
,		
the		
police		
made		
several		
arrests		
as		
demonstrators		
undertook		
a		
meandering		
march		
from		
Union		
Square		
to		
Times		
Square		 
.		 
Demonstrators		  
blocked		
streets		
in		
other		
cities		 
.		 
In		 
Washington		 
,		
protesters		
closed		
the		
14th		
Street		
Bridge		
and		
lay		
down		
in		
front		
of		
the		
Justice		
Department		 
.		 
At		  
Harvard		
Law		
School		 
,		
some		
300		
people		
gathered		
and		
chanted		 
,		
"		 
No		
justice		 
,		
no		
peace		 
,		 
"		
and		
hoisted		
a		
banner		
reading		 
,		
"		 
Your		
peace		
is		
violence		 
.		 
"		 
At		  
Washington		
University		
in		
St.		
Louis		 
,		
scores		
of		
students		
marched		
and		
then		
held		
a		
"		 
die-in		 
"		
in		
a		
campus		
lounge		 
.		 
They		 
lay		
silent		
on		
the		
floor		 
,		
a		
tangle		
of		
backpacks		
and		
winter		
coats		 
,		
for		
four		
and		
a		
half		
minutes		 
.		 
The		  
walkouts		
on		
Monday		
were		
coordinated		
by		
protest		
leaders		
who		
have		
sought		
to		
channel		
public		
discontent		
about		
the		
shooting		
and		
the		
subsequent		
grand		
jury		
decision		
to		
focus		
attention		
on		
larger		
questions		
of		
police		
policies		
and		
racial		
discrimination		 
.		 
Over		  
the		
Thanksgiving		
weekend		 
,		
protest		
organizers		
who		
say		
they		
view		
themselves		
as		
part		
of		
a		
broader		
movement		
against		
police		
brutality		
and		
racial		
profiling		 
,		
rather		
than		
advocates		
in		
a		
single		
case		 
,		
met		
in		
St.		
Louis		
to		
decide		
what		
to		
do		
next		 
.		 
They		 
were		
asked		
to		
put		
stickers		
beside		
goals		
that		
seemed		
the		
most		
significant		 
,		
including		
pressing		
for		
more		
elaborate		
reporting		
requirements		
by		
the		
police		
in		
cases		
in		
which		
officers		
use		
deadly		
force		 
,		
as		
well		
as		
the		
appointment		
of		
special		
prosecutors		
for		
police		
shootings		 
.		 
At		  
the		
Harvard		
protest		 
,		
Prof.		
Charles		
J.		
Ogletree		
Jr.		 
,		
founder		
of		
the		
law		
school		
's		
Charles		
Hamilton		
Houston		
Institute		
for		
Race		
and		
Justice		 
,		
exhorted		
students		
to		
fight		
for		
a		
more		
equitable		
society		 
.		 
"		   
Everyone		
has		
to		
get		
involved		 
.		 
Your		 
friends		 
,		
your		
neighbors		 
,		
even		
your		
enemies		 
,		 
"		
Professor		
Ogletree		
said		 
.		 
He		 
added		 
,		
"		 
We		
have		
to		
make		
sure		
that		
we		
are		
the		
people		
standing		
up		
for		
the		
people		
who		
find		
themselves		
victims		
of		
police		
violence		 
.		 
"		 
Derecka		  
Purnell		 
,		
a		
first-year		
law		
student		
from		
St.		
Louis		 
,		
said		
there		
had		
been		
little		
indication		
that		
the		
grand		
jury		
decision		
had		
made		
a		
significant		
impact		
in		
Harvard		
's		
classrooms		 
.		 
She		 
encouraged		
students		
to		
be		
more		
assertive		
about		
battling		
perceived		
injustices		 
.		 
"		   
Do		
n't		
live		
a		
contradiction		 
,		 
"		
Ms.		
Purnell		
said

She		 
added		 
:		
"		 
Be		
vocal

Be		 
present

"		 
Nearby		   
,		
about		
350		
students		
left		
Cambridge		
Rindge		
and		
Latin		
School		
and		
marched		
to		
Harvard		
Square		 
,		
where		
they		
met		
hundreds		
more		
demonstrators		 
,		
many		
from		
Harvard		 
,		
and		
blocked		
traffic		
before		
staging		
a		
die-in		 
.		 
"		   
We		
wanted		
to		
show		
that		
people		
's		
lives		
are		
being		
interrupted		 
,		 
"		
said		
Sydney		
Fisher		 
,		
17		 
,		
the		
student		
body		
president		 
,		
who		
is		
black		 
.		 
She		 
said		
her		
brothers		
often		
talked		
with		
her		
parents		
about		
how		
to		
interact		
with		
the		
police		 
.		 
"		   
It		
's		
petrifying		
to		
know		
that		
we		
're		
not		
safe		 
,		 
"		
she		
said		 
.		 
In		  
Iowa		
City		 
,		
about		
75		
people		
chanting		 
,		
"		 
Hands		
up		 
,		
do		
n't		
shoot		 
!		  
"		 
marched		
to		
a		
police		
station		
and		
to		
City		
Hall		
in		
18

degree		
weather		 
.		 
At		  
the		
University		
of		
California		 
,		
Los		
Angeles		 
,		
about		
15		
people		
gathered		
outside		
Campbell		
Hall		
and		
observed		
a		
moment		
of		
silence		 
.		 
Protests		 
were		
reported		
on		
several		
campuses		
around		
Southern		
California		 
.		 
"		   
We		
're		
out		
here		
not		
just		
because		
they		
called		
for		
a		
protest		 
,		
but		
because		
we		
all		
have		
a		
responsibility		
to		
put		
a		
stop		
sign		
in		
what		
can		
only		
be		
described		
as		
American		
genocide		
by		
these		
institutions		 
,

Tala		
Deloria		 
,		
a		
19		 
-		
year-old		
sophomore		 
,		
said		
at		
U.C.L.A.		 
Among		  
the		
protesters		
in		
New		
York		
was		
Ann		
Marie		
Jackson		 
,		
38		 
,		
from		
Canarsie		
in		
Brooklyn		 
,		
who		
said		
that		
her		
17		 
-		
year-old		
son		 
,		
who		
is		
black		 
,		
is		
often		
stopped		
without		
cause		
by		
police		
officers		 
.		 
Many		  
of		
the		
marchers		
were		
teenagers		
who		
had		
abandoned		
classes		
for		
a		
few		
hours		 
.		 
"		   
It		
's		
an		
outrage		
that		
this		
nonindictment		
could		
happen		
in		
this		
country		 
,

said		
Zoe		
Fruchter		 
,		
15

a		
student		
at

College		
in		
Manhattan

Kraebber

who		
attends		
Hunter		
College		
High		
School		
in		
Manhattan		 
,		
said		
the		
march		
was		
one		
of		
the		
few		
ways		
she		
could		
meaningfully		
register		
her		
opinion		 
.		 
"		  
We		
do		
n't		
have		
much		
political		
power		
right		
now		 
,		
being		
youths		 
,		
but		
this		
is		
something		
we		
can		
do		 
,		 
"		
she		
said		 
.		 
Gov.		  
Jay		
Nixon		
of		
Missouri		
said		
on		
Monday		
that		
there		
was		
no		
longer		
a		
need		
for		
a		
special		
legislative		
session		 
,		
which		
he		
had		
called		
to		
authorize		
more		
money		
for		
Ferguson-related		
expenses		
by		
the		
National		
Guard		
and		
the		
State		
Highway		
Patrol		 
.		 
He		 
and		
senior		
legislative		
leaders		
agreed		
that		
he		
could		
use		
his		
budget		
authority		
to		
cover		
the		
payments		 
.		 
In		  
Ferguson		
on		
Monday		 
,		
the		
first		
meeting		
of		
the		
Ferguson		
Commission		 
,		
which		
was		
formed		
to		
address		
community		
concerns		 
,		
began		
with		
several		
hours		
of		
discussion		
by		
members		
about		
the		
principles		
and		
commitments		
that		
would		
guide		
their		
work		 
.		 
But		 
after		
a		
restive		
audience		
member		
stood		
up		
and		
asked		
when		
the		
panel		
would		
take		
public		
comment		 
,		
others		
began		
shouting		
down		
the		
commission		
members		
as		
they		
tried		
to		
respond		 
.		 
Some		 
asserted		
that		
there		
were		
not		
enough		
Ferguson		
residents		
on		
the		
commission		 
,		
while		
others		
asked		
if		
the		
group		
was		
a		
sham		 
.		 
"		   
You		
do		
not		
understand		 
,		 
"		
said		
Shirlissa		
Pruitt		 
,		
41		 
,		
of		
Ferguson		 
.		 
"		  
You		
do		
not		
go		
through		
the		
things		
that		
the		
community		
goes		
through		 
.		 
How		 
can		
you		
fix		
what		
's		
going		
on		
in		
the		
community		
when		
you		
do		
n't		
even		
include		
the		
community		 
?		 
"		 
Commission		  
members		
eventually		
restored		
order		
and		
took		
their		
chairs		
out		
from		
behind		
a		
table		
to		
sit		
closer		
to		
the		
audience
