On		  
Holiday		 
,		
Ferguson		
Seeks		
to		
Salve		
Wounds		 
FERGUSON		   
,		
Mo.		
--		
The		
people		
who		
came		
to		
this		
boarded-up		
downtown		
on		
Thursday		
morning		
knew		
they		
could		
not		
do		
much		
to		
salve		
Ferguson		
's		
wounds		 
.		 
But		 
it		
was		
Thanksgiving		 
,		
and		
they		
felt		
they		
could		
not		
just		
sit		
home		 
,		
either		 
.		 
So		 
they		
brought		
paint		
brushes		
and		
prayers		 
,		
thermoses		
of		
coffee		
and		
trays		
of		
drop		
biscuits		 
,		
hoping		
to		
counterbalance		
the		
arsons		 
,		
angry		
protests		
and		
racial		
strife		 
.		 
"		   
This		
is		
a		
really		
small		
thing		 
,		 
"		
said		
Darcy		
Edwin		 
,		
26		 
,		
as		
she		
painted		
a		
pastel		
oak		
tree		
onto		
the		
plywood		
boards		
covering		
an		
optical		
shop		
on		
South		
Florissant		
Road		 
.		 
"		  
It		
's		
not		
going		
to		
fix		
any		
big		
issue		 
.		 
"		 
It		  
was		
cold		
and		
gray		
outside		 
,		
and		
the		
streets		
that		
had		
overflowed		
with		
demonstrators		
for		
the		
past		
few		
nights		
were		
eerily		
still		 
.		 
Into		 
this		
stepped		
Ms.		
Edwin		 
,		
a		
Ferguson		
resident		
who		
works		
as		
a		
teaching		
assistant		 
.		 
"		  
It		
's		
harder		
to		
stay		
in		 
,		 
"		
she		
said		 
.		 
The		  
looting		
and		
gunshots		 
,		
flaming		
buildings		
and		
clashes		
that		
erupted		
on		
Monday		
after		
a		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
not		
to		
indict		
a		
white		
police		
officer		
for		
fatally		
shooting		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		 
,		
cast		
a		
pall		
on		
the		
holiday		
for		
families		
around		
the		
St.		
Louis		
area		
and		
beyond		 
.		 
While		 
the		
governor		
of		
Missouri		 
,		
Jay		
Nixon		 
,		
ate		
a		
Thanksgiving		
meal		
with		
the		
National		
Guard		
troops		
who		
have		
been		
called		
up		
to		
secure		
the		
streets		
here		 
,		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
family		
and		
activists		
nationwide		
set		
aside		
empty		
chairs		
as		
dinner-table		
memorials		 
.		 
Around		  
midmorning		
on		
Thursday		 
,		
Carlton		
Lee		 
,		
pastor		
of		
the		
Flood		
Christian		
Church		 
,		
stood		
in		
a		
pulpit		
and		
talked		
about		
the		
work		
of		
his		
congregation		 
.		 
But		 
Mr.		
Lee		
was		
not		
speaking		
at		
Flood		 
.		 
Instead		  
,		
he		
was		
at		
Wellspring		
Church		 
,		
three		
days		
before		
he		
planned		
to		
hold		
a		
Sunday		
service		
in		
a		
parking		
lot		 
.		 
His		 
own		
church		
had		
been		
declared		
a		
total		
loss		 
,		
a		
casualty		
of		
a		
fire		
that		
burned		
late		
Monday		
amid		
the		
unrest		
here		 
.		 
He		  
talked		
of		
rebuilding		
a		
church		
from		
the		
rubble		 
,		
even		
though		
questions		
remain		
about		
whether		
an		
insurance		
policy		
will		
underwrite		
the		
project		 
.		 
"		   
I		
do		
n't		
know		
how		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Lee		
said		
in		
a		
soft		
voice		 
.		 
"		  
I		
do		
n't		
know		
when		 
.		 
But		 
I		
trust		
God		 
.		 
"		 
In		  
nearby		
St.		
Louis		 
,		
the		
unrest		
forced		
the		
city		
to		
put		
off		
its		
Thanksgiving		
Day		
parade		 
,		
and		
in		
New		
York		 
,		
protesters		
marched		
along		
the		
route		
of		
the		
Macy		
's		
parade		
and		
seven		
demonstrators		
were		
arrested		
in		
attempts		
to		
disrupt		
it		 
.		 
In		 
Ferguson		 
,		
officials		
postponed		
the		
Northern		
Lights		
celebration		
--		
an		
annual		
post-Thanksgiving		
holiday		
festival		
--		
as		
people		
waited		
to		
see		
whether		
tensions		
would		
flare		
again		
after		
two		
calmer		
nights		
of		
protest		 
.		 
"		   
It		
's		
very		
unfortunate		
because		
this		
festival		
is		
about		
the		
community		
coming		
together		 
,		 
"		
said		
Ferguson		
's		
mayor		 
,		
James		
Knowles		 
.		 
"		  
We		
light		
the		
Christmas		
tree		 
.		 
We		 
've		
got		
kids		
making		
gingerbread		
houses		 
.		 
We		 
've		
got		
music		
and		
carolers		
and		
horse		
carriage		
rides		 
.		 
There		 
's		
no		
reason		
to		
disrupt		
it		 
.		 
"		 
On		  
Thursday		 
,		
there		
was		
once		
again		
a		
heavy		
presence		
of		
law		
enforcement		
officials		
on		
the		
streets		 
,		
guarding		
the		
police		
station		
and		
a		
shopping		
center		 
,		
but		
few		
protesters		
were		
in		
sight		 
.		 
The		 
night		
before		 
,		
dozens		
of		
marchers		
rallied		
but		
they		
were		
outnumbered		
by		
the		
hundreds		
of		
National		
Guard		
troops		
and		
the		
police		
who		
fanned		
out		
across		
the		
region		 
.		 
The		 
marchers		
dispersed		
with		
no		
reports		
of		
damage		
and		
only		
two		
arrests		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Nixon		 
,		
who		
has		
been		
criticized		
for		
not		
deploying		
enough		
Guard		
forces		
to		
prevent		
Monday		
night		
's		
widespread		
chaos		 
,		
on		
Thursday		
thanked		
Guard		
members		
for		
spending		
the		
holiday		
away		
from		
their		
families		 
.		 
A		 
spokesman		
for		
the		
governor		
said		
separately		
that		
Mr.		
Nixon		
would		
not		
call		
for		
a		
special		
prosecutor		
to		
examine		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
case		 
.		 
A		 
federal		
civil		
rights		
investigation		
into		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
death		
is		
also		
underway		 
,		
but		
charges		
are		
not		
expected		
against		
the		
police		
officer		 
,		
Darren		
Wilson		 
.		 
For		  
many		
residents		
here		 
,		
Thursday		
brought		
a		
moment		
to		
reunite		
with		
one		
another		
after		
an		
anxious		
week		
of		
closed		
schools		 
,		
police		
barricades		
and		
relentless		
news		
media		
attention		 
.		 
At		 
the		
Wellspring		
Church		 
,		
black		
families		
and		
white		
families		
sat		
beneath		
blue		
stained-glass		
windows		 
,		
praying		
and		
singing		
songs		
that		
said		 
,		
"		 
Open		
the		
eyes		
of		
my		
heart		 
,		
Lord		 
.		  
"		 
Fittingly		 
,		
the		
pastor		 
,		
F.		
Willis		
Johnson		
Jr.		 
,		
discussed		
the		
Book		
of		
Job		
in		
his		
sermon		 
,		
and		
spoke		
of		
faithfulness		
amid		
uncertainty		
and		
turmoil		 
.		 
"		   
God		
is		
in		
control		
every		
day		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
,		
"		 
not		
the		
governor		 
,		
not		
the		
National		
Guard		 
.		  
"		 
But		
just		
outside		
the		
church		
were		
more		
concrete		
signs		
of		
control		 
.		 
A		 
National		
Guard		
vehicle		
was		
parked		
nearby		 
,		
as		
were		
many		
police		
cars		 
.		 
Businesses		 
were		
boarded		
up		 
,		
and		
South		
Florissant		
Road		
was		
nearly		
empty		 
.		 
Even		 
inside		
the		
church		 
,		
which		
has		
become		
a		
gathering		
place		
for		
demonstrators		 
,		
there		
was		
a		
handwritten		
sign		
with		
the		
familiar		
protest		
call		
of		
"		 
No		
Justice		 
,		
No		
Peace		 
!		 
"		 
After		  
the		
service		 
,		
as		
congregants		
made		
their		
way		
to		
a		
lunch		
table		
of		
turkey		 
,		
ham		 
,		
dressing		
and		
pumpkin		
pie		 
,		
Mr.		
Johnson		
said		
the		
holiday		
's		
arrival		
was		
a		
"		 
welcome		
relief		 
.		 
"		 
"		   
In		
many		
respects		 
,		
we		
've		
been		
locked		
in		
and		
on		
lockdown		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
"		  
We		
have		
not		
given		
over		
and		
expressed		
our		
best		
selves		
toward		
each		
other		 
,		
and		
so		
the		
expression		
of		
gratitude		 
,		
the		
extending		
of		
gift		
and		
grace		
through		
food		
and		
fellowship		 
,		
that		
is		
what		
not		
only		
this		
community		
strives		
toward		 
,		
but		
it		
's		
what		
we		
're		
called		
to		
be		 
.		 
"		 
Mr.		  
Johnson		 
,		
expressing		
a		
cautious		
hope		
shared		
by		
many		 
,		
predicted		
the		
worst		
of		
the		
unrest		
had		
passed		 
.		 
But		 
he		
said		
protests		
would		
continue		 
.		 
"		   
I		
do		
believe		
that		
civil		
disobedience		
and		
direct		
action		
will		
continue		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
"		  
I		
do		
believe		
that		
prayer		
and		
protest		
is		
still		
required		 
.		 
Our		 
hope		
is		
that		
that		
strand		 
,		
that		
dimension		 
,		
that		
right		
work		
and		
that		
righteous		
work		
will		
continue		
because		
that		
's		
what		
's		
required		 
.		 
"		 
Not		  
far		
away		 
,		
two		
young		
men		
walked		
down		
the		
street		 
,		
offering		
prayers		
for		
volunteers		 
.		 
Two		 
women		
from		
nearby		
St.		
Louis		
suburbs		
unloaded		
trays		
of		
bacon		
and		
biscuits		
to		
feed		
anyone		
who		
passed		
by		 
.		 
And		 
two		
families		
who		
had		
painted		
a		
Dr.		
Seuss-themed		
mural		
across		
a		
shuttered		
storefront		
moved		
on		
to		
extend		
their		
art		
to		
a		
Chinese		
restaurant		
next		
door		 
.		 
"		   
It		
's		
heartbreaking		
to		
drive		
down		
your		
own		
streets		
and		
see		
what		
looks		
like		
a		
disaster		
area		 
,		 
"		
said		
one		
mother		 
,		
Becky		
Kern-Ryan		 
,		
who		
lives		
just		
off		
Ferguson		
's		
main		
downtown		
district		 
.		 
One		 
of		
the		
children		
had		
suggested		
painting		
a		
dragon		 
,		
so		
they		
were		
getting		
to		
work		 
.		 
"		  
I		
just		
had		
a		
strong		
desire		
to		
do		
something		 
,		 
"		
she		
continued		 
.		 
"		  
This		
is		
what		
I		
can		
do		 
.		 
"
