Mo.		
--		
Police		
have		
stepped		
up		
arrests		
here		
in		
a		
bid		
to		
root		
out		
those		
they		
consider		
outside		
agitators		
without		
further		
angering		
peaceful		
demonstrators		 
,		
as		
unrest		
following		
the		
death		
of		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teen		
showed		
few		
signs		
of		
abating		 
.		 
More		  
than		
80		
people		
were		
arrested		
in		
a		
30		 
-		 
hour		
period		
into		
Tuesday		 
,		
far		
surpassing		
past		
totals		
given		
by		
authorities		
who		
are		
struggling		
to		
find		
a		
strategy		
to		
bring		
this		
seven-square		
mile		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		
under		
control		 
.		 
About		 
one-quarter		
of		
those		
arrested		
during		
that		
time		
are		
from		
outside		
the		
area		 
,		
from		
as		
far		
away		
as		
New		
York		
and		
San		
Francisco		 
,		
county		
records		
showed		 
.		 
Attention		  
in		
recent		
days		
began		
to		
shift		
to		
those		
outside		
protesters		 
,		
whom		
some		
local		
officials		
and		
even		
protest		
leaders		
blamed		
for		
using		
Molotov		
cocktails		 
,		
guns		
and		
fireworks		
to		
ignite		
greater		
discord		 
.		 
Attorney		 
General		
Eric		
Holder		 
,		
who		
is		
traveling		
to		
Ferguson		
on		
Wednesday		 
,		
said		
in		
an		
op-ed		
piece		
in		
the		
St.		
Louis		
Post-Dispatch		
that		
many		
of		
the		
acts		
of		
violence		
were		
being		
committed		
by		
those		
from		
outside		
Ferguson		 
.		 
"		   
Let		
's		
have		
a		
night		
that		
we		
can		
completely		
separate		
those		
good		
people		
exercising		
their		
First		
Amendment		
rights		
from		
those		
who		
are		
trying		
to		
co-opt		
this		
horrible		
situation		
into		
something		
to		
meet		
their		
own		
needs		 
,		 
"		
said		
Ferguson		
Mayor		
James		
Knowles		
III		
in		
a		
television		
interview		
on		
Tuesday		 
.		 
Still		   
,		
officials		
did		
n't		
let		
local		
protesters		
entirely		
off		
the		
hook		 
.		 
"		  
There		
are		
some		
outsiders		 
,		
but		
there		
are		
a		
lot		
of		
people		
who		
live		
here		 
,		 
"		
said		
Missouri		
State		
Highway		
Patrol		
Capt.		
Ronald		
Johnson		 
,		
who		
is		
overseeing		
security		
here		 
.		 
"		  
We		
ca		
n't		
just		
blame		
that		
on		
outside		
agitators		 
.		 
Yes		  
,		
there		
are		
some		 
,		
but		
many		
are		
people		
who		
live		
right		
here		
in		
Missouri		 
.		 
"		 
Meanwhile		   
,		
each		
step		
police		
and		
state		
officials		
have		
taken		
--		
from		
establishing		
a		
curfew		
to		
deploying		
the		
National		
Guard		
--		
brings		
its		
own		
frustration		
and		
confusion		
on		
the		
ground		 
.		 
The		 
arrests		
Monday		
into		
Tuesday		
touched		
off		
a		
new		
wave		
of		
criticism		
of		
police		 
.		 
Officers		  
have		
"		 
set		
the		
tone		
that		
this		
is		
a		
war		
zone		 
,		
and		
people		
think		
it		
's		
time		
for		
war		 
,		 
"		
said		
Antonio		
French		 
,		
a		
St.		
Louis		
alderman		
who		
has		
become		
one		
of		
the		
faces		
of		
the		
protests		 
.		 
The		  
police		
tactics		
at		
times		
have		
become		
as		
large		
of		
an		
issue		
as		
the		
death		
of		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
who		
was		
shot		
and		
killed		
by		
a		
policeman		
on		
Aug.		
9		 
.		 
Frustrating		 
protesters		
has		
been		
conflicting		
accounts		
around		
the		
death		
of		
the		
unarmed		
18		 
-		
year-old		
and		
the		
trickle		
of		
information		
in		
recent		
days		 
,		
including		
a		
disclosure		
by		
police		
that		
said		
Mr.		
Brown		
was		
involved		
in		
a		
robbery		
shortly		
before		
his		
death		 
.		 
Protesters		  
said		
getting		
a		
handle		
on		
the		
number		
of		
arrests		
has		
been		
a		
struggle		 
.		 
The		 
number		
showing		
nearly		
80		
people		
detained		
Monday		
into		
Tuesday		 
,		
mostly		
for		
refusal		
to		
disperse		 
,		
came		
from		
the		
St.		
Louis		
County		
jail		 
,		
where		
a		
protest		
arrestee		
is		
most		
likely		
to		
be		
processed		 
.		 
County		 
officials		
said		
additional		
arrestees		
were		
taken		
to		
other		
jails		 
,		
but		
those		
numbers		
were		
still		
being		
compiled

Arielle

those		
who

he		
was		
arrested		
as		
he		
was		
leaving		
the		
protest		
on		
Monday		 
.		 
He		 
was		
charged		
with		
unlawful		
use		
of		
a		
weapon		
after		
the		
gun		
he		
says		
he		
was		
legally		
carrying		
was		
found		
to		
be		
concealed		 
,		
for		
which		
he		
does		
n't		
have		
a		
permit		 
.		 
He		 
said		
he		
had		
the		
gun		
"		 
to		
protect		
myself		 
,		 
"		
adding		 
,		
"		 
I		
should		
have		
never		
done		
that		 
.		 
"		 
And		  
while		
some		
who		
have		
arrived		
are		
looking		
to		
stir		
up		
trouble		 
,		
according		
to		
authorities		
and		
community		
leaders		 
,		
others		
have		
come		
to		
protest		
the		
death		
of		
Mr.		
Brown		
peacefully
