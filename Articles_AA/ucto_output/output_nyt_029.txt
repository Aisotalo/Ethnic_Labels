been		
in		
frequent		
touch		
with

as		
angry		
protests		
continued

said		
the		
decision		
was		
the		
result		
of		
"		 
extraordinary		
circumstances		 
"		
in		
the		
case		 
,		
and		
was		
part		
of		
a		
civil		
rights		
investigation		
the		
F.B.I.		
is		
conducting		 
.		 
The		  
order		
for		
an		
additional		
autopsy		
may		
also		
help		
the		
Obama		
administration		
to		
reassure		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
family		
and		
others		
who		
are		
suspicious		
of		
the		
state		
's		
investigation		
and		
are		
eager		
for		
an		
independent		
inquiry

something		
that		
Mr.

promised		
the		
family		
personally		 
.		 
Brian		  
Fallon		 
,		
a		
Justice

consider		
the		
results		
of		
the		
first		 
,		
state-conducted		
autopsy

There		 
was		
no		
indication		
that

saw		
any		
problems

local		
examination

taking		
leisurely		
dinners

,		
White		
House		
officials		
said		
Sunday		
that		
the		
situation		
in		
Ferguson		
had		
dominated		
his		
working		
time		
over		
the		
past		
several		
days		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Obama		
received		
briefings		
several		
times		
a		
day

including		
at		
least		
once		
each		
day		
by		
Mr.

Valerie		 
Jarrett		 
,		
who		
heads		
the		
White		
House		
office		
of		
outreach

has		
also		
talked		
daily		
with		
Mr.		
Nixon		 
,		
his		
staff		 
,		
local		
elected		
officials		
and		
leaders		
from		
national		
civil		
rights		
organizations		 
.		 
"		   
Any		
time		
you		
have		
a		
situation		
like		
this		
that		
spirals		
quickly		
to		
a		
boiling		
point		
and		
where		
people		
are		
looting		
and		
getting		
hurt		 
,		
it		
's		
a		
concern		
for		
the		
president		 
,		 
"		
Ms.		
Jarrett		
said		
in		
an		
interview		
from		
Martha		
's		
Vineyard		 
,		
where		
she		
was		
also		
vacationing		 
.		 
Officials		  
said		
Mr.		
Nixon		 
,		
a		
Democrat		 
,		
had		
not		
asked		
for		
federal		
troops		
to		
help		
keep		
the		
peace		
in		
Ferguson		 
.		 
But		 
40		
additional		
agents		
from		
the		
F.B.I.		
arrived		
in		
Missouri		
on		
Saturday		
to		
assist		
with		
the		
federal		
investigation		 
,		
Mr.		
Nixon		
said		
Sunday		 
.		 
Officials		  
with		
the		
F.B.I.		
and		
the		
Justice		
Department		
have		
said		
investigators		
interviewed		
several		
witnesses		
to		
the		
shooting		
and		
were		
canvassing		
the		
area		
for		
others		 
.		 
"		   
That		
's		
the		
kind		
of		
independent		 
,		
external		 
,		
national		
review		
and		
investigation		
of		
this		
that		
I		
think		
will		
assist		
everyone		
in		
making		
sure		
we		
get		
to		
justice

Mr.		
Nixon

The		  
tensions		
in		
Ferguson		
are		
shaping		
up		
as		
a		
signature		
moment		
for		
Mr.		
Holder		 
,		
who		
has		
made		
civil		
rights		
issues		
a		
cornerstone		
of		
his		
tenure		
and		
who		
has		
indicated		
he		
will		
most		
likely		
leave		
office		
by		
the		
end		
of		
the		
year		 
.		 
The		 
attorney		
general		
has		
fought		
against		
policies		
such		
as		
racial		
profiling		
and		
mandatory		
minimum		
sentences		 
,		
which		
he		
believes		
discriminate		
against		
minorities		
and		
undermine		
their		
confidence		
in		
the		
criminal		
justice		
system		 
.		 
The		 
Ferguson		
protests		
have		
touched		
on		
both		
themes		 
.		 
White		  
House		
officials		
said		
the		
shooting		
of		
Mr.		
Brown		
and		
the		
reaction		
among		
AfricanAmerican		
in		
Ferguson		
were		
also		
another		
instance		
in		
which		
the		
president		
's		
policy		
response		
is		
motivated		
in		
part		
by		
a		
deep		 
,		
personal		
connection		
to		
the		
issues		
of		
race		
and		
justice		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Obama		
has		
in		
the		
past		
spoken		
in		
emotional		
terms		
about		
racial		
issues		 
,		
including		
the		
shooting		
of		
Trayvon		
Martin		 
,		
an		
unarmed		
young		
black		
man		
in		
Florida		 
,		
and		
the		
acquittal		
of		
the		
man		
who		
shot		
him		 
,		
George		
Zimmerman		 
.		 
The		 
president		
's		
aides		
said		
the		
situation		
in		
Ferguson		
had		
affected		
him		
in		
similar		
ways		 
.		 
"		   
He		
wants		
to		
make		
sure		
that		
he		
's		
doing		
everything		
in		
his		
power		
to		
ensure		
a		
thorough		
investigation

Ms.

said

"		  
He		
wants		
to		
make		
sure		
that		
there		
's		
continuing		
exploration		
of		
ways		
that		
they		
are		
keeping		
the		
violence		
down		 
,		
reducing		
it		
down		
to		
zero		 
.		 
"		 
White		  
House		
officials		
said		
Mr.		
Obama		
had		
not		
lost		
confidence		
in		
Mr.		
Nixon		
or		
State		
Highway		
Patrol		
officers		
in		
Missouri		 
;		
one		
official		
described		
them		
as		
"		 
acting		
in		
good		
faith		 
"		
to		
help		
resolve		
the		
situation		 
.		 
But		 
the		
official		
stressed		
that		
the		
White		
House		
did		
not		
necessarily		
believe		
the		
same		
of		
the		
local		
police		
in		
Ferguson		 
.		 
Behind		  
the		
scenes		 
,		
administration		
officials		
have		
sought		
to		
minimize		
the		
potential		
for		
angry		
reaction		
on		
the		
streets		
of		
the		
city		 
.		 
The		  
Justice		
Department		
asked		
the		
Ferguson		
police		
not		
to		
release		
surveillance		
footage		
of		
a		
convenience		
store		
robbery		
in		
which		 
,		
police		
said		 
,		
Mr.		
Brown		
was		
a		
suspect		 
,		
because		
of		
concerns		
that		
"		 
it		
would		
roil		
the		
community		
further		 
,		 
"		
a		
federal		
law		
enforcement		
official		
said		
on		
Saturday		 
.		 
The		  
Ferguson		
Police		
Department		
released		
the		
video		
on		
Friday		 
,		
and		
the		
official		
said		
it		
"		 
occurred		
over		
the		
objection		
of		
federal		
authorities		 
.		  
"		 
Federal		
investigators		
had		
a		
copy		
of		
the

there		
were		
never		
any		
plans		
by		
the		
federal		
investigators		
to		
release		
that

Mr.

with		
members

Mr.

on		
Sunday		
that		
he		
believed		
that

took		
the		
form		
of
