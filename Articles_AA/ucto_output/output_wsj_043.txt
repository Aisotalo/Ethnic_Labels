Crime

Protest		 
Thanksgiving		  
was		
quiet		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Missouri		
after		
Governor		
Jay		
Nixon		
finally		
deployed		
enough		
National		
Guard		
troops		
to		
protect		
the		
public		 
.		 
The		 
violence		
and		
looting		
that		
destroyed		
businesses		
were		
a		
disgrace		 
,		
as		
were		
the		
media		
rationalizations		
for		
rioting		
in		
the		
wake		
of		
a		
grand		
jury		
decision		
not		
to		
indict		
police		
officer		
Darren		
Wilson		 
.		 
Meanwhile		   
,		
in		
Milwaukee		
last		
week		 
,		
police		
chief		
Edward		
Flynn		
was		
asked		
about		
his		
encounter		
with		
protestors		
at		
a		
public		
hearing		
in		
response		
to		
an		
April		
police		
shooting		 
.		 
His		 
passionate		
response		 
,		
caught		
on		
video		
by		
the		
Milwaukee		
Journal		
Sentinel		 
,		
went		
viral		
and		
is		
better		
than		
anything		
we		
could		
write		
about		
crime		 
,		
race		
and		
protest		
in		
America		 
:		 
"		   
Well		 
,		
I		
was		
on		
my		
phone		 
.		 
And		  
,		
yes		 
,		
that		
's		
true		 
.		 
I		 
was		
following		
developments		
of		
the		
five-year-old		
little		
girl		
sitting		
on		
her		
Dad		
's		
lap		
who		
just		
got		
shot		
in		
the		
head		
by		
a		
drive-by		
shooting		 
.		 
If		 
some		
of		
the		
people		
here		
gave		
a		
good		
god		
damn		
about		
the		
victimization		
of		
people		
in		
this		
community		
by		
crime		 
,		
I		
'd		
take		
some		
of		
their		
invective		
more		
seriously		 
.		 
"		   
The		
greatest		
racial		
disparity		
in		
the		
city		
of		
Milwaukee		
is		
getting		
shot		
and		
killed		 
.		 
Hello		  
.		 
Eighty-per		 
cent		
of		
my		
homicide		
victims		
every		
year		
are		
AfricanAmerican		 
.		 
Eighty-per		 
cent		
of		
our		
aggravated		
assault		
victims		
are		
AfricanAmerican		 
.		 
Eighty-per		 
cent		
of		
our		
shooting		
victims		
who		
survive		
their		
shooting		
are		
AfricanAmerican		 
.		 
Now		 
they		
know		
all		
about		
the		
last		
three		
people		
who		
have		
been		
killed		
by		
the		
Milwaukee		
Police		
Department		
over		
the		
course		
of		
the		
last		
several		
years

There		 
's		
not		
one		
of		
them		
who		
can		
name		
one		
of		
the		
last		
three		
homicide		
victims		
we		
've		
had		
in		
this		
city

"		   
Now		 
,		
there		
's		
room		
for		
everybody		
to		
participate		
in		
fixing		
this		
police		
department

And		 
I		
'm		
not		
pretending		
we		
're		
without		
sin		 
.		 
But		 
this		
community		
's		
at		
risk		
all		
right		 
.		 
And		 
it		
's		
not		
because		
men		
and		
women		
in		
blue		
risk		
their		
lives		
protecting		
it		 
.		 
It		 
's		
at		
risk		
because		
we		
have		
large		
numbers		
of		
high-capacity		 
,		
quality		
firearms		
in		
the		
hands		
of		
remorseless		
criminals		
who		
do		
n't		
care		
who		
they		
shoot
