Pastor

Just		 
a		
few		
days		
earlier		 
,		
the		
church		
that		
is		
his		
livelihood

his		
love		
had		
been		
destroyed		
by		
fire		
in

that		
engulfed

after

learned		
that		
the

officer		
who		
shot		
and		
killed		
Michael

would		
not

No

who		
is		
the		
Brown		
family		
pastor		
-		
if		
it		
was		
a		
bit		
difficult		
to		
be		
thankful		
this		
year

With		 
the		
whole		
family		
watching		
his		
crestfallen		
face		 
,		
Lee		
took		
a		
deep		
breath		 
,		
and		
began		 
:

This

just		
been

Since

As

Monday		 
,		
Lee		
attempted		
unsuccessfully		
to		
chase		
away		
looters		
and		
put		
out

along

Then		 
his

rang

on

told		
him

the		
time		
Lee		
arrived

his

had		
been
