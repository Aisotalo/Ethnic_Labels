The		  
Other		
Ferguson		
Tragedy		 
We		  
now		
know		
that		
Michael		
Brown		
was		
much		
more		
of		
a		
menace		
than		
a		
martyr		 
,		
but		
that		
wo		
n't		
stop		
liberals		
from		
pushing		
an		
anti-police		
narrative		
that		
harms		
the		
black		
poor		
in		
the		
name		
of		
helping		
them		 
.		 
The		  
black		
teen		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
,		
robbed		
a		
store		 
,		
attacked		
a		
white		
police		
officer		
and		
was		
shot		
dead		
while		
resisting		
arrest		 
.		 
That		 
was		
the		
conclusion		
of		
a		
St.		
Louis		
County		
grand		
jury		
that		
brought		
no		
charges		
against		
the		
officer		
after		
considering		
all		
the		
physical		
evidence		 
,		
along		
with		
eyewitness		
accounts		
from		
blacks		
in		
the		
vicinity		
of		
the		
confrontation		 
.		 
Not		  
that		
any		
amount		
of		
evidence		
would		
have		
stopped		
the		
hooligans		
in		
Ferguson		
Monday		
night		
who		
were		
determined		
use		
Brown		
's		
death		
as		
a		
pretext		
for		
more		
bad		
behavior		 
.		 
Nor		 
will		
evidence		
thwart		
liberals		
who		
are		
bent		
on		
making		
excuses		
for		
black		
criminality		
and		
pretending		
that		
police		
shootings		
are		
responsible		
for		
America		
's		
high		
black		
body		
count		 
.		 
According		  
to		
the		
FBI		 
,		
homicide		
is		
the		
leading		
cause		
of		
death		
among		
young		
black		
men		 
,		
who		
are		
10		
times		
more		
likely		
than		
their		
white		
counterparts		
to		
be		
murdered		 
.		 
And		 
while		
you		
'd		
never		
know		
it		
watching		
MSNBC		 
,		
the		
police		
are		
not		
to		
blame		 
.		 
Blacks		 
are		
just		
13		 
%		
of		
the		
population		
but		
responsible		
for		
a		
majority		
of		
all		
murders		
in		
the		
U		 
.		  
S		  
.		  
,		 
and		
more		
than		
90		 
%		
of		
black		
murder		
victims		
are		
killed		
by		
other		
blacks		 
.		 
Liberals		 
like		
to		
point		
out		
that		
most		
whites		
are		
killed		
by		
other		
whites		 
,		
too		 
.		 
That		 
's		
true		
but		
beside		
the		
point		
given		
that		
the		
white		
crime		
rate		
is		
so		
much		
lower		
than		
the		
black		
rate		 
.		 
Blacks		  
commit		
violent		
crimes		
at		
7		
to		
10		
times		
the		
rate		
that		
whites		
do		 
.		 
The		 
fact		
that		
their		
victims		
tend		
to		
be		
of		
the		
same		
race		
suggests		
that		
young		
black		
men		
in		
the		
ghetto		
live		
in		
danger		
of		
being		
shot		
by		
each		
other		 
,		
not		
cops		 
.		 
Nor		 
is		
this		
a		
function		
of		
"		 
over-policing		 
"		
certain		
neighborhoods		
to		
juice		
black		
arrest		
rates		 
.		 
Research		 
has		
long		
shown		
that		
the		
rate		
at		
which		
blacks		
are		
arrested		
is		
nearly		
identical		
to		
the		
rate		
at		
which		
crime		
victims		
identify		
blacks		
as		
their		
assailants		 
.		 
The		 
police		
are		
in		
these		
communities		
because		
that		
's		
where		
the		
emergency		
calls		
originate		 
,		
and		
they		
spend		
much		
of		
their		
time		
trying		
to		
stop		
residents		
of		
the		
same		
race		
from		
harming		
one		
another		 
.		 
Former		  
New		
York		
Mayor		
Rudy		
Giuliani		
pointed		
this		
out		
recently		
on		
"		 
Meet		
the		
Press		 
"		
in		
a		
debate		
with		
sociologist		
Michael		
Eric		
Dyson		 
.		 
"		  
What		
about		
the		
poor		
black		
child		
that		
is		
killed		
by		
another		
black		
child		 
?		 
Why		 
are		
n't		
you		
protesting		
that		 
?		  
"		 
Mr.		
Giuliani		
asked		 
.		 
"		   
Those		
people		
go		
to		
jail		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Dyson		
responded		 
.		 
"		  
I		
do		
protest		
it		 
.		 
I		 
'm		
a		
minister		 
.		 
They		 
go		
to		
jail		 
.		 
"		 
Mr.		  
Dyson		
might		
want		
to		
try		
protesting		
a		
little		
harder		 
.		 
Chicago		 
had		
507		
murders		
in		
2012		 
,		
only		
26		 
%		
of		
which		
were		
solved		 
.		 
"		  
To		
put		
it		
another		
way		 
:		
About		
three-quarters		
of		
the		
people		
who		
killed		
someone		
in		
Chicago		
in		
2012		
have		
gotten		
away		
with		
murder		
--		
so		
far		 
,		
at		
least		 
,		 
"		
Chicago		
Magazine		
noted		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Dyson		
and		
others		
on		
the		
left		
are		
not		
oblivious		
to		
this		
black		
pathology		 
,		
but		
they		
are		
at		
pains		
even		
to		
acknowledge		
it		 
,		
let		
alone		
make		
it		
a		
focus		 
.		 
Instead		  
,		
liberals		
spend		
their		
time		
spotlighting		
white		
racism		 
,		
real		
or		
imagined		 
,		
and		
touting		
it		
as		
an		
all-purpose		
explanation		
for		
bad		
black		
outcomes		 
.		 
Ferguson		  
helps		
further		
that		
agenda		
in		
ways		
that		
Chicago		
does		
not		 
.		 
Hence		  
,		
the		
left		
posits		
that		
the		
Michael		
Brown		
shooting		
is		
the		
norm		 
,		
even		
though		
the		
data		
show		
that		
it		
's		
the		
exception		 
.		 
And		 
if		
black		
criminal		
behavior		
is		
a		
response		
to		
white		
racism		 
,		
how		
is		
it		
that		
black		
crime		
rates		
were		
lower		
in		
the		
1940		 
s		
and		
1950		 
s		 
,		
when		
black		
poverty		
was		
higher		 
,		
racial		
discrimination		
was		
rampant		
and		
legal		 
,		
and		
the		
country		
was		
more		
than		
a		
half-century		
away		
from		
twice		
electing		
a		
black		
president		 
?		 
Racial		  
profiling		
and		
tensions		
between		
the		
police		
and		
poor		
black		
communities		
are		
real		
problems		 
,		
but		
these		
are		
effects		
rather		
than		
causes		 
,		
and		
they		
ca		
n't		
be		
addressed		
without		
also		
addressing		
the		
extraordinarily		
high		
rates		
of		
black		
criminal		
behavior		
--		
yet		
such		
discussion		
remains		
taboo		 
.		 
Blacks		 
who		
bring		
it		
up		
are		
sell-outs		 
.		 
Whites		 
who		
mention		
it		
are		
racists

Mr.		 
Dyson		
accused		
Mr.		
Giuliani		
of		
"		 
white		
supremacy

"		  
)		
But		
so		
long		
as		
young		
black		
men		
are		
responsible		
for		
an		
outsize		
portion		
of		
violent		
crime		 
,		
they		
will		
be		
viewed		
suspiciously		
by		
law		
enforcement		
and		
fellow		
citizens		
of		
all		
races		 
.		 
Pretending		  
that		
police		
behavior		
is		
the		
root		
of		
the		
problem		
is		
not		
only		
a		
dodge		
but		
also		
foolish		 
.		 
The		 
riots		
will		
succeed		
in		
driving		
business		
out		
of		
town		 
,		
which		
means		
that		
Ferguson		
's		
residents		
will		
be		
forced		
to		
pay		
more		
at		
local		
stores		
or		
travel		
farther		
for		
competitive		
prices		
on		
basic		
goods		
and		
services		 
.		 
Many		 
Ferguson		
residents		
today		
ca		
n't		
go		
work		
because		
local		
businesses		
have		
been		
burned		
down		 
.		 
Even		  
worse		 
,		
when		
you		
make		
police		
targets		 
,		
you		
make		
low-income		
communities		
less		
safe		 
.		 
Ferguson		 
's		
problem		
is		
n't		
white		
cops		
or		
white		
prosecutors		 
;		
it		
's		
the		
thug		
behavior		
exhibited		
by		
individuals		
like		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
which		
puts		
a		
target		
on		
the		
backs		
of		
other		
young		
black		
men		 
.		 
Romanticizing		 
such		
behavior		
instead		
of		
condemning		
it		
only		
makes		
matters		
worse		 
.
