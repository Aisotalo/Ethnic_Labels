predominately		
AfricanAmerican		 
,		
while		
the		
city		
leadership

police		
force		
has		
remained		
mostly		
white

ease		
rancor		
over		
the		
exit		
of		
a		
superintendent		
from		
the		
Ferguson-Florissant		
school		
district		
in		
a		
controversy		
that		
broke		
at		
times		
along		
racial		
lines		 
.		 
Anger		  
was		
also		
stoked		
in		
the		
area

district

"		   
You

see		
some		
of		
that		
tension		
when

accreditation

The		  
Ferguson-Florissant		
school		
district		 
,		
which		
was		
set		
to		
start		
the

Thursday

said		
Wednesday		
it		
was		
pushing		
back		
the		
start		
of		
classes		
to		
Monday

said		
she		
has		
had		
conversations		
with		
her		
12		 
-		
year-old		
son		
about		
how		
to		
act		
when		
stopped		
by		
the		
police		 
,		
something		
she		
said

a		
daily		
concern

.		 
Thomas		  
Jackson		 
,		
chief		
of		
the

said		
he		
is		
working		
to		
recruit		
more		
minority		
officers		 
.		 
Currently		  
,		
only		
three		
of		
the		
force		
's		
53		
officers		
are		
AfricanAmerican		 
,		
which		
he		
says		
creates		
a		
perceived		
disconnect		
between		
residents		
and		
police		 
.		 
The		  
7		 
-		
square-mile		
city		
has		
many		
low-slung		
homes		
on		
leafy		
side		
roads		
broken		
by		
an		
occasional		
apartment		
complex

In		 
the		
center		
of		
downtown

there		
are		
a		
few		
upscale		
bars		
and		
shops

But		 
a		
few		
miles		
away		 
,		
where		
the		
bulk		
of		
the		
protests		
have		
happened

some		
businesses		
have		
long		
been		
boarded

who		
represents		
Ferguson		 
,		
hopes		
outrage		
will		
turn		
into		
political		
activity		 
.		 
The		 
six-member		
city		
council		
has		
one		
black		
member		 
,		
and		
government		
data		
show		
that		
while		
there		
are		
about		
15,000		
residents		
who		
are		
18		
and		
older

only		
about		
1,500
