Holder		
said		
forging		
trust		
between		
the		
police		
and		
the		
public		
"		 
is		
all-important		 
,		
but		
it		
is		
also		
fragile

It		 
requires		
that		
force		
be		
used		
in		
appropriate		
ways

Mr.

to		
attend		
a

vigil		
next		
Tuesday		
that		
they		
say		
they		
hope		
would		
calm		
the		
situation

"		  
I		
think		
white		
clergy

black		
clergy		
ought		
to		
be		
moved		
to		
come		
to		
Ferguson

let

pray
