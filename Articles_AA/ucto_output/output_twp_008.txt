The

are		
an		
uncomfortable		
reminder

the		
militarization

One		  
of		
the		
ways		
police		
departments		
have		
armed		
themselves		
in		
recent		
years		
is		
through		
the		
Defense		
Department		
's		
excess		
property		
program		 
,		
known		
as		
the		
1033		
Program		 
.		 
It		 
"		 
permits		
the		
Secretary		
of

to		
transfer

LEAs		 
)		 
,		 
"		
according		
to		
the		
National		
Law		
Enforcement		
and		
Corrections		
Technology		
Center		 
.		 
The		  
1033		
program		
has		
transferred		
more		
than		
$	CURRENCY	 
4.3		
billion		
in		
equipment		
since		
its		
inception		
in		
1997		 
.		 
In		 
2013		
alone		
it		
gave		
nearly		
half		
a		
billion		
dollars		
worth		
of		
military		
equipment		
to		
local		
law		
enforcement		
agencies		 
,		
according		
to		
the		
program		
's		
website		 
.		 
The		  
program		
provides		
things		
like		
office		
equipment		 
,		
tents		 
,		
generators		 
,		
pick-up		
trucks		
and		
ATVs		 
,		
according		
to		
a		
PowerPoint		
presentation		
on		
its		
website		 
.		 
But		 
law		
enforcement		
agencies		
can		
also		
use		
it		
to		
obtain		
military		
aircraft		 
,		
weapons		
(		 
including		
grenade		
launchers		 
)		 
,		
and		
heavily		
armored		
tactical		
vehicles		 
.		 
Law		  
enforcement		
agencies		
can		
browse		
online		
to		
obtain		
small		
arms		
and		
other		
materials		 
.		 
Getting		 
an		
armored		
personnel		
carrier		
is		
slightly		
more		
complicated		 
,		
requiring		
the		
completion		
of		
a		
one-page		
request		
form		
in		
which		
you		
can		
indicate		
your		
preference		
for		
a		
vehicle		
that		
has		
either		
wheels		
or		
tracks		
like		
a		
tank		 
.		 
"		  
Once		
ordered		 
,		
arrangements		
for		
pick-up		
or		
delivery		
must		
be		
made		
within		
14		
days		 
,		 
"		
according		
to		
the		
website		 
.		 
The		  
1033		
program		
has		
its		
roots		
in		
the		
war		
on		
drugs		 
.		 
It		 
arose		
from		
"		 
Subtitle		
C		
-		
Counter-Drug		
Activities		 
"		
in		
the		
National		
Defense		
Authorization		
Act		
of		
fiscal		
year		
1997		 
.		 
The		 
act		
gives		
preference		
to		
"		 
those		
applications		
indicating		
that		
the		
transferred		
property		
will		
be		
used		
in		
the		
counter-drug		
or		
counter-terrorism		
activities		
of		
the		
recipient		
agency		 
.		 
"		 
Part		  
of		
the		
thinking		
behind		
the		
1033		
program		
was		
that		
if		
law		
enforcement		
personnel		
were		
waging		
a		
drug		
war		 
,		
they		
should		
be		
outfitted		
like		
warriors		 
.		 
Priority		 
for		
tactical		
vehicle		
requests		
is		
still		
given		
to		
law		
enforcement		
agencies		
in		
"		 
high		
intensity		
drug		
trafficking		
areas		 
,		 
"		
which		
according		
to		
the		
DEA		
cover		
about		
60		
percent		
of		
the		
total		
U.S.		
population		 
.		 
Among		 
other		
things		 
,		
the		
program		
's		
FAQ		
page		
states		
that		
law		
enforcement		
agencies		
can		
use		
its		
four		
wheel		
drive		
vehicles		
to		
"		 
haul		
away		
marijuana		 
.		 
"		 
Taken		  
at		
face		
value		
the		
program		
makes		
a		
certain		
degree		
of		
sense		 
:		
military		
equipment		
that		
would		
otherwise		
be		
destroyed		
instead		
gets		
diverted		
to		
cash-strapped		
local		
law		
enforcement		
agencies		 
.		 
But		 
in		
some		
cases		 
,		
particularly		
with		
the		
heavy		
equipment		 
,		
the		
program		
may		
actually		
be		
a		
money		
loser		 
.		 
According		  
to		
an		
interview		
with		
Marine		
General		
Joseph		
Dunford		
in		
DoDBuzz		 
,		
an		
online		
defense		
journal		 
,		
the		
heavily		
armored		
tactical		
vehicles		
known		
as		
MRAPs		
might		
cost		
about		
$	CURRENCY	 
10,000		
each		
to		
destroy		
in		
the		
field		
in		
places		
like		
Afghanistan		 
.		 
But		 
it		
costs		
up		
to		
$	CURRENCY	 
50,000		
to		
bring		
each		
one		
back		
to		
the		
States

Beyond		  
financial		
considerations		 
,		
there		
does		
n't		
seem		
to		
be		
much		
wisdom		
in		
arming		
small		
town		
police		
agencies		
like		
military		
forces		 
.		 
The		 
police		
chief		
of		
Keene		 
,		
N.H.		
(		 
pop		 
.		
23,000		 
)		
famously		
justified		
the		
acquisition		
of		
an		
armored		
tactical		
vehicle		
to		
patrol		
the		
town		
's		
"		 
Pumpkin		
Festival		
and		
other		
dangerous		
situations		 
,		 
"		
according		
to		
The		
Economist		 
.		 
The		  
needs		
of		
an		
occupying		
military		
force		
are		
distinct		
from		
those		
of		
a		
local		
law		
enforcement		
agency		 
.		 
Effective		 
policing		
requires		
much		
more		
than		
overwhelming		
firepower		 
.		 
It		 
entails		 
,		
among		
other		
things		 
,		
working		
with		
the		
local		
community		
to		
gain		
its		
trust		 
.		 
But		 
it		
's		
difficult		
to		
do		
that		
when		
you		
're		
staring		
community		
members		
down		
from		
atop		
the		
gun		
turret		
of		
an		
armored		
vehicle		 
,		
as		
St.		
Louis		
County		
police		
officers		
did		
Wednesday

in		
Ferguson
