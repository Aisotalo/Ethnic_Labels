Mo.		
--		
One		
day		
after		
roiling		
tensions		
over		
the		
police		
shooting		
of		
a		
black		
teenager		
here		
began		
to		
subside		 
,		
emotions		
flared		
anew		
on		
Friday		
as		
the		
police		
identified		
the		
officer		
involved		
but		
also		
released		
evidence		
that		
the		
victim		
was		
a		
suspect		
in		
a		
convenience		
store		
robbery		
moments		
before		
being		
shot		 
.		 
The		  
manner		
in		
which		
the		
police		
here		
released		
the		
information		 
,		
which		
included		
a		
19		 
-		 
page		
police		
report		
on		
the		
robbery		
but		
no		
new		
details		
about		
the		
shooting		 
,		
led		
to		
the		
spectacle		
of		
dueling		
police		
news		
conferences		 
,		
one		
led		
by		
a		
white		
officer		
who		
seemed		
ill		
at		
ease		
and		
defensive		 
,		
and		
the		
other		
dominated		
by		
a		
charismatic		
black		
officer		
who		
expressed		
solidarity		
with		
the		
crowd		
even		
as		
he		
pleaded		
for		
peace		 
.		 
The		  
white		
officer		 
,		
Thomas		
Jackson		 
,		
the		
police		
chief		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
gave		
a		
series		
of		
incomplete		
accounts		
that		
sowed		
confusion		
about		
whether		
the		
officer		
who		
shot		
the		
teenager		
knew		
he		
was		
a		
suspect		
in		
the		
robbery		 
.		 
The		 
black		
officer		 
,		
Capt.		
Ronald		
S.		
Johnson		
of		
the		
Missouri		
State		
Highway		
Patrol		 
,		
expressed		
his		
displeasure		
with		
how		
the		
information		
had		
been		
released		 
.		 
"		   
I		
would		
have		
liked		
to		
have		
been		
consulted		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		
pointedly		
about		
the		
pairing		
of		
the		
shooter		
's		
identity		
with		
the		
robbery		
accusation		 
.		 
All		  
week		 
,		
community		
members		
had		
demanded		
the		
name		
of		
the		
officer		
who		
killed		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
18		 
,		
last		
Saturday		 
,		
but		
when		
it		
finally		
came		 
,		
it		
was		
accompanied		
by		
surveillance		
videotapes		
that		
appeared		
to		
show		
Mr.		
Brown		
shoving		
a		
store		
clerk		
aside		
as		
he		
stole		
a		
box		
of		
cigarillos		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Brown		
's		
family		 
,		
their		
lawyer		
and		
others		
in		
the		
community		
expressed		
disgust		 
,		
accusing		
the		
police		
of		
trying		
to		
divert		
attention		
from		
the		
central		
issue		
--		
the		
unexplained		
shooting		
of		
an		
unarmed		
young		
man		 
.		 
"		   
It		
is		
smoke		
and		
mirrors		 
,		 
"		
said		
Benjamin		
L.		
Crump		 
,		
a		
lawyer		
for		
the		
Brown		
family		 
,		
of		
the		
robbery		
allegations		 
.		 
"		  
Nothing		 
,		
based		
on		
the		
facts		
before		
us		 
,		
justifies		
the		
execution-style		
murder		
by		
this		
police		
officer		
in		
broad		
daylight		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
videotapes		
seemed		
to		
contradict		
the		
image		
portrayed		
by		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
family		
of		
a		
gentle		
teenager		
opposed		
to		
violence		
and		
on		
his		
way		
to		
college		 
.		 
Captain		  
Johnson		 
,		
who		
grew		
up		
in		
the		
area		
and		
had		
been		
brought		
in		
by		
the		
governor		
on		
Thursday		
to		
restore		
peace		
after		
days		
of		
confrontations		
between		
demonstrators		
and		
the		
police		
in		
riot		
gear		
and		
military-style		
vehicles		 
,		
said		
he		
had		
not		
been		
told		
that		
the		
authorities		
planned		
to		
release		
the		
video		
of		
the		
robbery		
along		
with		
the		
name		
of		
the		
officer		 
.		 
But		 
he		
sought		
to		
calm		
people		
down		 
,		
saying		 
,		
"		 
In		
our		
anger		 
,		
we		
have		
to		
make		
sure		
that		
we		
do		
n't		
burn		
down		
our		
own		
house		 
.		 
"		 
Captain		  
Johnson		
won		
over		
many		
but		
also		
faced		
skepticism		
over		
his		
role		
along		
with		
anguished		
questions		
about		
who		
the		
police		
really		
represent		
and		
the		
lack		
of		
educational		
and		
economic		
opportunities		
in		
Ferguson		 
.		 
"		   
I		
find		
it		
utterly		
disgusting		 
,		 
"		
one		
man		
shouted		
at		
him		 
.		 
"		  
What		
am		
I		
supposed		
to		
tell		
my		
people		 
?		 
It		 
looks		
like		
you		
're		
a		
figurehead		 
.		 
"		 
Gov.		  
Jay		
Nixon		 
,		
a		
Democrat		 
,		
stood		
next		
to		
Captain		
Johnson		
at		
their		
news		
conference		
and		
emphasized		
that		
the		
details		
released		
Friday		
were		
not		
"		 
the		
full		
picture		 
.		  
"		 
He		
added		 
,		
"		 
I		
think		
the		
focal		
point		
here		
remains		
to		
figure		
out		
how		
and		
why		
Michael		
Brown		
was		
killed		
and		
to		
get		
justice		
as		
appropriate		
in		
that		
situation		 
.		 
"		 
Later		  
Friday		 
,		
the		
Justice		
Department		 
,		
which		
is		
conducting		
a		
separate		
civil		
rights		
investigation		
into		
the		
killing		 
,		
announced		
that		
teams		
of		
F.B.I.		
agents		
would		
be		
canvassing		
the		
neighborhood		
where		
shooting		
took		
place		
in		
the		
next		
several		
days		 
.		 
The		  
day		
began		
when		
Chief		
Jackson		
said		
at		
a		
news		
conference		
that		
the		
officer		
who		
shot		
Mr.		
Brown		
was		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
who		
has		
served		
almost		
three		
years		
in		
Ferguson		
and		
two		
in		
another		
local		
department		
and		
had		
no		
disciplinary		
charges		 
.		 
Officer		 
Wilson		 
,		
who		
is		
white		 
,		
has		
been		
placed		
on		
leave		 
,		
and		
his		
location		
is		
unknown		 
.		 
But		  
the		
release		
of		
his		
name		
was		
overshadowed		
by		
the		
simultaneous		
announcement		
of		
the		
robbery		
allegations		 
,		
leading		
to		
questions		
about		
timing		
and		
motives		 
.		 
In		  
a		
later		
news		
conference		 
,		
on		
Friday		
afternoon		
at		
Forestwood		
Park		 
,		
a		
sports		
complex		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Chief		
Jackson		
said		
that		
Officer		
Wilson		
had		
not		
been		
aware		
that		
Mr.		
Brown		
"		 
was		
a		
suspect		
in		
the		
case		 
"		
and		
instead		
had		
stopped		
him		
and		
a		
companion		
"		 
because		
they		
were		
walking		
down		
the		
street		
blocking		
traffic		 
.		 
"		 
But		  
that		
only		
highlighted		
the		
central		
issue		 
:		
How		
did		
an		
officer		
's		
interaction		
with		
an		
unarmed		
young		
man		
escalate		
into		
a		
deadly		
shooting		 
?		 
The		  
videotapes		 
,		
from		
an		
unidentified		
convenience		
store		 
,		
show		
a		
tall		
burly		
man		 
,		
identified		
by		
the		
police		
as		
Mr.		
Brown		 
,		
shoving		
aside		
a		
clerk		
as		
he		
left		
the		
store		
with		
an		
unpaid-for		
box		
of		
Swisher		
Sweets		
cigarillos		 
.		 
According		 
to		
a		
police		
report		 
,		
Mr.		
Brown		
was		
accompanied		
at		
the		
store		
by		
his		
friend		
Dorian		
Johnson		 
,		
who		
was		
also		
with		
him		
when		
he		
was		
shot		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Johnson		
has		
admitted		
being		
in		
the		
convenience		
store		
with		
Mr.		
Brown		
and		
told		
investigators		
from		
the		
F.B.I.		
and		
St.		
Louis		
County		
that		
Mr.		
Brown		
did		
"		 
take		
cigarillos		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Johnson		
's		
lawyer		 
,		
Freeman		
Bosley		
Jr.		 
,		
a		
former		
mayor		
of		
St.		
Louis		 
,		
told		
MSNBC		 
.		 
Standing		  
near		
a		
store		
that		
was		
vandalized		
during		
protests		
this		
week		 
,		
Mark		
Jackson		 
,		
who		
has		
participated		
in		
the		
demonstrations		 
,		
expressed		
skepticism		
about		
police		
motives		
in		
describing		
the		
robbery		 
.		 
"		  
They		
just		
want		
to		
make		
the		
case		
seem		
more		
reasonable		
on		
their		
side		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
"		  
But		
at		
the		
end		
of		
the		
day		 
,		
the		
man		
did		
n't		
have		
a		
gun		 
,		
so		
they		
did		
n't		
have		
to		
shoot		
him		 
.		 
In		  
his		
afternoon		
appearance		 
,		
Chief		
Jackson		
sought		
to		
explain		
why		
the		
information		
was		
released		
on		
Friday		 
.		 
"		  
All		
I		
did		
was		
release		
the		
videotape		
because		
I		
had		
to		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
"		  
I		
had		
been		
sitting		
on		
it		 
.		  
"		 
He		
said		
his		
hand		
was		
forced		
by		
requests		
by		
the		
news		
media		
under		
public		
records		
laws		 
.		 
He		 
acknowledged		
that		
he		
had		
not		
alerted		
the		
other		
police		
departments		
about		
the		
tape		 
.		 
"		  
I		
should		
have		
done		
that		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
Chief		  
Jackson		
described		
Officer		
Wilson		
as		
"		 
a		
gentle		 
,		
quiet		
man		 
"		
and		
"		 
a		
distinguished		
officer		 
.		 
"		 
Greg		  
Kloeppel		 
,		
a		
lawyer		
for		
the		
union		
representing		
the		
Ferguson		
police		 
,		
said		
Officer		
Wilson		
received		
an		
award		
for		
"		 
extraordinary		
effort		
in		
the		
line		
of		
duty		 
"		
in		
February		 
.		 
The		  
police		
have		
not		
released		
the		
official		
report		
on		
the		
shooting		
because		
it		
is		
now		
the		
subject		
of		
federal		
and		
local		
investigations		 
.		 
In		 
the		
robbery		
report		
released		
Friday		 
,		
an		
officer		
wrote		
that		
"		 
it		
is		
worth		
mentioning		
that		
this		
incident		
is		
related		
to		 
"		
the		
fatal		
shooting		
of		
Mr.		
Brown		 
.		 
After		  
seeing		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
body		
and		
reviewing		
the		
surveillance		
video		 
,		
"		 
I		
was		
able		
to		
confirm		
that		
Brown		
is		
the		
primary		
suspect		 
"		
in		
the		
robbery		 
,		
the		
officer		
wrote		 
.		 
Any		  
suggestion		
that		
Officer		
Wilson		
sought		
out		
Mr.		
Brown		
and		
Mr.		
Johnson		
because		
they		
were		
robbery		
suspects		 
,		
however		 
,		
was		
dispelled		
by		
the		
police		
chief		
at		
the		
afternoon		
news		
conference		 
.		 
Adding		 
to		
the		
day		
's		
confusion		 
,		
Chief		
Jackson		
told		
The		
St.		
Louis		
Post-Dispatch		
later		
on		
Friday		
that		
while		
Officer		
Wilson		
did		
not		
originally		
approach		
the		
two		
youths		
as		
suspects		 
,		
he		
was		
aware		
of		
the		
nearby		
store		
robbery		 
.		 
The		  
officer		
has		
said		
that		
once		
he		
saw		
cigars		
in		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
hand		 
,		
he		
"		 
realized		
that		
he		
might		
be		
the		
robber

"		
Chief		
Jackson		
said		 
.		 
After		  
the		
revelations		
of		
the		
day		 
,		
the		
atmosphere		
in		
Ferguson		
on		
Friday		
night		
remained		
peaceful		 
,		
though		
boisterous		 
.		 
Cars		 
clogged		
streets		
as		
horns		
blared		
and		
music		
played		 
.		 
Hundreds		 
of		
demonstrators		
clutched		
signs		
and		
chanted		
slogans		 
,		
but		
many		
others		
danced		
to		
music		 
.		 
On		 
one		
street		 
,		
six		
people		
danced		
atop		
a		
white		
delivery		
truck		 
.		 
The		  
police		
presence		
was		
limited		 
.		 
But		 
among		
the		
officers		
on		
the		
street		
was		
Captain		
Johnson		 
,		
who		
walked		
among		
the		
crowds		 
,		
posing		
for		
pictures		
and		
shaking		
hands		 
.		 
"		   
I		
'm		
pleased		
with		
how		
it		
's		
going

This

has		
been		
revised		
to		
reflect		
the		
following		
correction		 
:		
An		
article		
on		
Aug.		
16		
about		
a		
decision		
by		
the		
police		
department		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
,		
to		
identify		
the		
officer		
involved		
in		
the		
fatal		
shooting		
of		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
using		
information		
from		
the		
department

misstated		
the		
number		
of		
years		
that		
the		
officer		 
,		
Darren		
Wilson

has		
been		
a		
police		
officer

request		 
,		
Mr.		
Wilson		
has		
served		
with		
the		
Ferguson		
department		
for		
almost		
three		
years

not		
four

giving		
him		
five

six
