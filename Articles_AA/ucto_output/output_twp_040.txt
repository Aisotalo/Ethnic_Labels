Monday

's		
reaction		
to		
a		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
not		
to		
indict		
the		
Ferguson		
police		
officer		
who		
killed		
an		
unarmed		
young		
black		
man		
in		
August		
consisted		
of		
peaceful		
protest		
in		
some		
places		
and		
vandalism		
and		
looting		
in		
others		
-		
a		
burst		
of		
violence		
so		
widely		
and		
persistently		
predicted		
that		
it		
seemed		
as		
much		
self-fulfilling		
prophecy		
as		
organic		
expression		
of		
rage		 
.		 
Spontaneous		  
or		
organized		 
,		
riots		
have		
sporadically		
pierced		
the		
social		
compact		
through		
two		
and		
a		
half		
centuries		
of		
this		
country		
's		
struggles		
over		
equality		
and		
opportunity		 
.		 
But		 
August		
's		
violence		
in		
Ferguson		
broke		
the		
mold		
in		
three		
important		
ways		
-		
one		
of		
which		
is		
just		
unfolding		
now		 
.		 
These		 
were		
rare		
suburban		
riots		 
,		
racial		
violence		
coming		
to		
the		
very		
place		
many		
Americans		
-		
both		
white		
and		
black		
-		
had		
fled		
to		
after		
the		
urban		
unrest		
of		
the		
1960		 
s		 
.		 
These		 
were		
the		
most		
significant		
explosions		
of		
racial		
frustration		
since		
the		
election		
of		
the		
nation		
's		
first		
black		
president		 
,		
and		
so		
Ferguson		
forced		
the		
country		
out		
of		
the		
fantasy		
that		
America		
had		
entered		
a		
"		 
post-racial		 
"		
era		 
.		 
Finally		   
,		
what		
distinguishes		
Ferguson		
from		
the		
crowded		
historical		
catalogue		
of		
racially		
motivated		
street		
violence		
is		
what		
has		
happened		
in		
recent		
weeks		 
:		
The		
unseemly		
build-up		
to		
the		
announcement		
of		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
conclusion		
that		
no		
crime		
was		
committed		
in		
the		
shooting		
death		
of		
18		 
-		
year-old		
Michael		
Brown		
has		
produced		
an		
expectation		
of		
ugliness		 
.		 
What		 
occurred		
Monday		
night		
-		
and		
may		
continue		
in		
the		
days		
ahead		
-		
is		
rioting		
as		
planned		
event		 
,		
so		
pervasively		
predicted		 
,		
so		
extensively		
prepared		
for		
as		
to		
obscure		
the		
power		
and		
meaning		
of		
the		
protests		 
.		 
A		  
news		
media		
obsessed		
with		
predicting		
the		
next		
step		 
,		
a		
security		
apparatus		
equipped		
to		
put		
down		
almost		
any		
uprising		 
,		
and		
a		
political		
power		
structure		
apparently		
seeking		
to		
head		
off		
violence		
by		
predicting		
it		
have		
combined		
to		
produce		
an		
unprecedented		
sense		
of		
inevitability		 
,		
reducing		
what		
has		
historically		
been		
an		
explosion		
of		
frustration		
to		
a		
kind		
of		
staged		
performance		 
.		 
From		  
Missouri		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		
's		
declaration		
of		
a		
state		
of		
emergency		
to		
reports		
of		
soaring		
gun		
sales		
in		
the		
St.		
Louis		
area		 
,		
from		
nonstop		
coverage		
on		
the		
cable		
news		
channels		
to		
new		
expenditures		
by		
St.		
Louis		
County		
police		
on		
riot		
gear		 
,		
the		
assumption		
(		 
fed		
by		
copious		
news		
leaks		 
)		
that		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
the		
white		
officer		 
,		
would		
not		
be		
prosecuted		
led		
to		
an		
hourly		
drumbeat		
of		
preparations		
for		
mayhem		 
.		 
Police		  
officers		 
'		
vacations		
were		
canceled		
and		
schoolchildren		
were		
sent		
home		
with		
packets		
of		
homework		
designed		
to		
last		
them		
through		
several		
days		
of		
civil		
unrest		 
.		 
The		  
result		
was		
a		
pivot		
from		
the		
questions		
of		
justice		
and		
race		
relations		
that		
drove		
August		
's		
protests		
to		
a		
more		
tactical		
debate		
over		
how		
to		
contain		
popular		
rage		 
.		 
Thanks		  
to		
a		
relentlessly		
forward-skewed		
news		
media		
-		
"		 
What		
will		
happen		
next		 
?		  
"		 
was		
the		
topic		
of		
nearly		
every		
cable		
news		
discussion		
-		
Monday		
night		
's		
violence		
became		
on-demand		
programming		
for		
a		
nation		
that		
flits		
from		
one		
blockbuster		
event		
to		
the		
next		 
.		 
The		  
days		
of		
anticipation		
diminished		
the		
debate		
over		
solutions		
that		
the		
Brown		
shooting		
had		
initially		
revived		 
.		 
The		 
Justice		
Department		
is		
still		
investigating		
police		
practices		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
the		
ACLU		
is		
still		
probing		
the		
Ferguson		
police		
department		
's		
treatment		
of		
journalists		
who		
covered		
the		
August		
protests		 
,		
and		
state		
officials		
are		
still		
looking		
at		
ways		
to		
reform		
law		
enforcement		
in		
the		
area		 
.		 
But		  
the		
complaints		
among		
black		
residents		
in		
Ferguson		
and		
beyond		
about		
police		
misconduct		
and		
courts		
that		
do		
n't		
seem		
to		
administer		
justice		
equally		
have		
not		
abated		 
.		 
Communities		  
across		
the		
nation		
regularly		
take		
to		
the		
streets		
to		
protest		
police		
shootings		
of		
unarmed		
black		
men		 
;		
in		
Ferguson		
's		
case		 
,		
the		
anger		
and		
frustration		
that		
turned		
protests		
violent		
was		
born		
of		
a		
larger		
sense		
of		
disenfranchisement		 
,		
a		
pervasive		
belief		
that		
some		
people		
-		
blacks		 
,		
low-end		
workers		 
,		
the		
unemployed		
-		
ca		
n't		
get		
a		
break		 
,		
ca		
n't		
wedge		
a		
foot		
in		
the		
door		 
.		 
"		   
We		
are		
a		
nation		
of		
two		
societies		 
,		
one		
black		 
,		
one		
white		
-		
separate		
and		
unequal		 
,		 
"		
the		
Kerner		
Commission		
famously		
concluded		
after		
the		
urban		
riots		
of		
the		
late		
1960		 
s		 
.		 
Since		 
then		 
,		
a		
large		
and		
successful		
black		
middle		
class		
has		
emerged		 
,		
and		
many		
legal		
and		
cultural		
barriers		
to		
inclusion		
in		
the		
nation		
's		
business		
and		
social		
endeavors		
have		
fallen		
away		 
.		 
But		  
the		
races		
remain		
sharply		
divided		
in		
important		
ways		
in		
both		
perception		
and		
reality		 
.		 
In		 
a		
survey		
of		
St.		
Louis		
County		
residents		
a		
month		
after		
the		
initial		
violence		 
,		
blacks		
and		
whites		
split		
over		
whether		
the		
shooting		
was		
justified		
(		 
62		
percent		
of		
whites		
said		
it		
was		 
;		
65		
percent		
of		
black		
said		
it		
was		
not		 
)		
and		
over		
whether		
Brown		
was		
targeted		
because		
of		
his		
race		
(		 
77		
percent		
of		
whites		
said		
No		 
,		
64		
percent		
of		
blacks		
said		
Yes		 
.		 
)		
The		
only		
thing		
a		
majority		
of		
both		
races		
agreed		
on		
was		
that		
the		
news		
media		
has		
made		
the		
situation		
in		
Ferguson		
worse		 
,		
not		
better		 
.		 
The		  
violence		
in		
Ferguson		
has		
not		
so		
far		 
,		
however		 
,		
prompted		
the		
national		
debate		
that		
President		
Barack		
Obama		
called		
for		
Monday		
night		
when		
he		
said		 
,		
"		 
We		
still		
have		
work		
to		
do		
here		 
.		
.		
.		
.		 
There		 
are		
still		
problems		 
,		
and		
communities		
of		
color		
are		
n't		
just		
making		
those		
problems		
up		 
.		 
"		 
For		  
protesters		
and		
those		
who		
agree		
with		
them		 
,		
the		
death		
of		
Michael		
Brown		
has		
joined		
those		
of		
Eric		
Garner		
in		
New		
York		
City		 
,		
Trayvon		
Martin		
in		
Sanford		 
,		
Florida		 
,		
and		
Oscar		
Grant		
in		
a		
transit		
station		
in		
Oakland		 
,		
California		 
,		
in		
a		
roll		
call		
of		
young		
black		
men		
whose		
violent		
end		
is		
a		
reminder		
of		
the		
reservoir		
of		
mistrust		
and		
misapprehension		
that		
divides		
AfricanAmerican		
from		
those		
in		
charge		
of		
the		
state		
's		
use		
of		
force		 
.		 
But		 
for		
many		
other		
Americans		 
,		
the		
most		
concerning		
aspect		
of		
the		
events		
in		
Ferguson		
has		
been		
the		
disorder		
in		
the		
streets		 
.		 
Blacks		  
are		
more		
than		
six		
times		
as		
likely		
as		
whites		
to		
say		
that		
police		
have		
discriminated		
against		
them		
because		
of		
their		
race		 
,		
according		
to		
a		
CBS		 
/		 
New		
York		
Times		
poll		
taken		
after		
the		
Ferguson		
shooting		 
.		 
Combine		 
that		
with		
the		
paucity		
of		
black		
officers		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
where		
about		
two-thirds		
of		
residents		
are		
AfricanAmerican		 
,		
and		
a		
familiar		
plaint		
of		
powerlessness		
and		
frustration		
leads		
to		
the		
same		
kind		
of		
reaction		
that		
has		
followed		
other		
such		
police		
shootings		
of		
unarmed		
black		
men		
over		
the		
past		
half-century

In		  
Ferguson		 
,		
signs		
of		
change		
quickly		
followed		
the		
riots		 
.		 
The		 
city		
decided		
in		
September		
to		
set		
up		
a		
citizen		
review		
board		
to		
monitor		
its		
police		
department		 
,		
and		
the		
City		
Council		
moved		
to		
scrap		
a		
system		
in		
which		
court		
fines		
were		
used		
to		
fund		
a		
significant		
chunk		
of		
Ferguson		
's		
budget		 
.		 
And		 
St.		
Louis		
officials		
are		
considering		
a		
massive		
overhaul		
of		
the		
county		
's		
system		
of		
dispersing		
political		
power		
to		
small		
municipal		
governments		 
,		
which		
some		
say		
has		
contributed		
to		
inequalities		
of		
resources		 
,		
power		
and		
administration		
of		
justice		
in		
the		
region		 
.		 
The		  
Brown		
family		
came		
to		
Washington		
in		
the		
fall		
to		
press		
for		
an		
anti-racial		
profiling		
bill		
similar		
to		
one		
that		
followed		
the		
Rodney		
King		
episode		
in		
Los		
Angeles		
(		 
that		
law		
required		
the		
FBI		
to		
track		
police		
brutality		
statistics		
but		
did		
not		
require		
local		
police		
forces		
to		
report		
them		 
)		 
.		 
Efforts		  
at		
the		
start		
of		
the		
2000		 
s		
to		
ban		
racial		
profiling		
in		
local		
policing		
-		
President		
George		
W.		
Bush		
vowed		
to		
"		 
end		
racial		
profiling

were		
soon		
eclipsed		
by		
the		
expansion		
of		
police		
powers		
in		
the		
Patriot		
Act		
that		
responded		
to		
the		
terrorist		
attacks		
of		
September		
11		 
,		
2001		 
.		 
Throughout		  
the		
nation		
and		
especially		
in		
low-income		
areas		 
,		
the		
divide		
that		
the		
Kerner		
Commission		
described		
persists		 
,		
and		
issues		
of		
poverty		
and		
race		
are		
far		
less		
present		
in		
national		
political		
campaigns		
and		
media		
discussions		
today		
than		
they		
were		
four		
decades		
ago		 
.		 
Instead		  
of		
discussions		
about		
what		
might		
be		
done		
to		
diminish		
the		
likelihood		
of		
racial		
violence		 
,		
the		
popular		
debate		
focused		
over		
the		
past		
week		
on		
how		
big		
the		
explosion		
of		
anger		
would		
be		 
.		 
In		 
recent		
days		 
,		
it		
was		
easy		
to		
find		
at		
least		
a		
dozen		
online		
polls		
asking		
something		
along		
the		
lines		
of		 
,		
"		 
Will		
there		
be		
race		
riots		
in		
Ferguson		 
?		 
"		 
On		  
the		
left		
and		
right		
alike		 
,		
there		
are		
complaints		
that		
the		
quick		
round		
of		
tsk-tsking		
that		
followed		
the		
August		
shooting		
did		
not		
equate		
to		
taking		
seriously		
the		
deep		
sense		
of		
injustice		
and		
inequality		
that		
pervades		
not		
only		
AfricanAmerican		
communities		 
,		
but		
many		
other		
parts		
of		
the		
nation		
as		
well		 
.		 
"

on		
the

,		
that		
same		
new		
technology		
could		
be		
the		
basis		
for		
a		
far		
more		
palpable		
kind		
of		
change		
than		
study		
commissions		
or		
task		
forces		
have		
produced		
in		
the		
past		 
.		 
In		 
earlier		
decades		 
,		
arguments		
over		
police		
shootings		
would		
consist		
of		
debate		
between		
the		
official		
police		
version		
and		
the		
word		
of		
a		
witness		
or		
two		
with		
a		
different		
account		 
.		 
Now		  
,		
the		
entire		
nation		
can		
see		
the		
shooting		 
,		
the		
aftermath		 
,		
the		
investigation		
-		
Brown		
's		
body		
laying		
in		
the		
street		 
,		
construction		
workers		
gasping		
in		
horror		
after		
the		
shooting		 
,		
every		
twist		
and		
turn		
in		
the		
presentations		
to		
the		
grand		
jury		 
.		 
A		 
mother		
's		
grief		
gets		
played		
on		
an		
endless		
loop		
and		
so		
does		
a		
cop		
's		
defense		 
.		 
The		  
omnipresence		
of		
video		
in		
this		
surveillance		
society		
creates		
both		
a		
new		
accountability		
for		
police		
officers		
-		
one		
that		
many		
departments		
now		
welcome		 
,		
equipping		
their		
officers		
with		
body		
cameras		
-		
and		
a		
potentially		
real		
shift		
in		
power		
on		
the		
streets
