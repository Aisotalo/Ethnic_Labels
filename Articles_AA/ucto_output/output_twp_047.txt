Ferguson		  
decision		
underscores		
the		
need		
for		
police		
body		
cameras		 
After		  
weeks		
of		
anticipation		 
,		
protesters		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Missouri		 
,		
heard		
on		
Monday		
night		
the		
news		
they		
had		
feared		 
:		
A		
St.		
Louis		
County		
grand		
jury		
declined		
to		
indict		
Ferguson		
police		
Officer		
Darren		
Wilson		
in		
the		
killing		
of		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
an		
unarmed		
AfricanAmerican		
teenager		
shot		
dead		
by		
Wilson		
this		
summer		 
.		 
The		  
burning		
and		
looting		
of		
local		
businesses		
that		
followed		
cannot		
be		
condoned		
or		
excused		 
.		 
But		 
the		
frustrations		
of		
Ferguson		
residents		
-		
most		
of		
whom		
have		
behaved		
lawfully		
since		
protests		
began		
over		
the		
summer		
-		
are		
more		
than		
understandable		 
.		 
A		 
life		
had		
been		
lost		
needlessly		 
.		 
Now		 
the		
process		
of		
holding		
Wilson		
to		
account		
had		
gone		
easy		
on		
the		
officer		 
.		 
And		 
though		
the		
grand		
jury		
declined		
to		
indict		
Wilson		 
,		
the		
evidence		
it		
heard		
-		
even		
Wilson		
's		
own		
account		
-		
makes		
clear		
that		
wiser		
policing		
on		
that		
August		
day		
would		
have		
saved		
a		
life		 
.		 
St.		  
Louis		
prosecutors		
used		
kid		
gloves		
when		
questioning		
Wilson		
before		
the		
grand		
jury		 
.		 
They		 
practically		
coached		
the		
officer		
to		
describe		
the		
area		
where		
the		
shooting		
occurred		
as		
hostile		
to		
police		 
.		 
They		 
went		
out		
of		
their		
way		
to		
note		
that		
Wilson		
cooperated		
with		
investigators		 
.		 
A		 
more		
challenging		
process		
would		
have		
pressed		
Wilson		
on		
critical		
details		 
,		
such		
as		
why		
he		
got		
out		
of		
his		
cruiser		
in		
pursuit		
of		
Brown		
after		
an		
initial		
confrontation		
with		
the		
teenager		 
,		
rather		
than		
waiting		
for		
backup		 
.		 
That		 
would		
have		
required		
self		 
-		
restraint		 
,		
but		
it		
also		
might		
have		
prevented		
Brown		
's		
death		 
.		 
The		 
record		
brings		
home		
how		
justice		
would		
have		
been		
better		
served		
had		
Missouri		
authorities		
named		
a		
special		
prosecutor		
to		
pursue		
the		
case		 
.		 
Despite		  
all		
of		
this		 
,		
President		
Barack		
Obama		
was		
right		
Monday		
night		
when		
he		
called		
on		
people		
to		
respect		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		 
.		 
The		 
process		
was		
n't		
perfect		 
,		
but		
it		
was		
legally		
legitimate		 
,		
the		
result		
of		
12		
citizens		
poring		
over		
reams		
of		
conflicting		
evidence		 
.		 
Given		 
the		
contradictory		
nature		
of		
much		
of		
the		
record		 
,		
the		
grand		
jurors		
faced		
a		
tough		
call		 
,		
and		
a		
trial		
might		
very		
well		
have		
resulted		
in		
an		
acquittal		 
.		 
One		  
immediate		
lesson		
from		
Ferguson		
is		
that		
the		
police		
should		
be		
collecting		
more		
evidence		
all		
of		
the		
time		
-		
by		
means		
of		
body		
cameras		
worn		
by		
officers		 
.		 
The		 
grand		
jurors		
had		
access		
to		
plenty		
of		
eyewitness		
accounts		 
,		
but		
those		
varied		
dramatically		 
.		 
Cameras		  
,		
too		 
,		
have		
drawbacks		 
.		 
They		 
ca		
n't		
show		
what		
's		
happening		
off-screen		 
,		
which		
can		
lead		
to		
false		
impressions		 
.		 
Police		 
can		
manipulate		
camera		
angles		
or		
even		
disable		
the		
devices		 
.		 
Yet		 
experience		
suggests		
that		 
,		
among		
other		
things		 
,		
increased		
use		
by		
police		
of		
body		
cameras		
tends		
to		
reduce		
the		
number		
of		
confrontations		 
.		 
It		  
's		
hard		
to		
know		
how		
this		
incident		
would		
have		
played		
out		
with		
cameras		
recording		
the		
encounter		 
.		 
Perhaps		 
the		
grand		
jury		
would		
have		
had		
a		
clearer		
picture		
of		
who		
attacked		
whom		
first		 
,		
whether		
Brown		
charged		
at		
Wilson		
before		
he		
was		
shot		
and		
whether		
Brown		
insisted		
that		
he		
was		
n't		
armed		 
.		 
It		 
's		
also		
possible		
that		
the		
confrontation		
would		
have		
occurred		
differently		 
,		
or		
not		
at		
all		 
.
