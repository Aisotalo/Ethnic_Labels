WASHINGTON		  
--		
President		
Obama		 
,		
in		
an		
interview		
broadcast		
on		
Sunday		 
,		
said		
he		
rejects		
Republican		
criticism		
that		
he		
has		
exceeded		
his		
authority		
in		
moving		
to		
spare		
millions		
of		
undocumented		
immigrants		
from		
deportation		 
,		
adding		
that		
he		
has		
been		
"		 
very		
restrained		 
"		
in		
his		
use		
of		
executive		
authority		 
.		 
Angry		  
Republican		
lawmakers		
have		
accused		
Mr.		
Obama		
of		
unconstitutional		 
,		
even		
imperial		 
,		
overreach		 
.		 
They		 
have		
pointed		
to		
past		
remarks		
in		
which		
he		
himself		
suggested		
that		
his		
powers		
to		
act		
were		
limited		 
.		 
But		  
Mr.		
Obama		 
,		
in		
the		
interview		
aired		
Sunday		
on		
the		
ABC		
News		
program		
"		 
This		
Week		 
,		 
"		
said		
that		
history		
was		
on		
his		
side		 
.		 
Both		 
Democratic		
and		
Republican		
presidents		 
,		
going		
back		
decades		 
,		
had		
taken		
similar		
actions		 
,		
he		
said		 
.		 
"		   
The		
history		
is		
that		
I		
have		
issued		
fewer		
executive		
actions		
than		
most		
of		
my		
predecessors		 
,		
by		
a		
long		
shot		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		
in		
the		
interview		 
,		
which		
was		
taped		
Friday		 
.		 
"		  
The		
difference		
is		
the		
response		
of		
Congress		
--		
and		
specifically		
the		
response		
of		
some		
of		
the		
Republicans		 
.		 
"		 
He		  
said		
historians		
of		
the		
modern		
presidency		
would		
confirm		
that		
he		
had		
"		 
actually		
been		
very		
restrained		 
.		 
"		 
Mr.		  
Obama		
has		
framed		
his		
action		
not		
as		
an		
amnesty		
for		
some		
undocumented		
immigrants		
but		
as		
a		
directive		 
,		
in		
part		 
,		
to		
federal		
agencies		
to		
focus		
their		
attention		
on		
those		
with		
criminal		
records		 
,		
not		
on		
law-abiding		 
,		
taxpaying		 
,		
longtime		
immigrants		 
.		 
In		 
all		 
,		
about		
five		
million		
of		
the		
estimated		
11		
million		
undocumented		
immigrants		
would		
be		
protected		 
.		 
"		   
The		
fact		
is		
that		
we		
exercise		
prosecutorial		
discretion		
all		
the		
time		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
,		
adding		
that		
Republicans		
remained		
free		
to		
pass		
an		
immigration		
law		
that		
would		
overturn		
his		
own		
actions		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Obama		
was		
also		
asked		
in		
the		
interview		
about		
concerns		
of		
possible		
violence		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
,		
and		
about		
the		
outlines		
of		
the		
2016		
presidential		
race		 
.		 
In		  
Ferguson		 
,		
a		
grand		
jury		
is		
expected		
to		
decide		
shortly		
whether		
to		
indict		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
a		
white		
police		
officer		 
,		
in		
the		
fatal		
shooting		
on		
Aug.		
9		
of		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
a		
black		
teenager		 
.		 
The		 
F.B.I.		
has		
warned		
of		
potential		
violence		
there		
and		
in		
other		
cities		
across		
the		
country		 
,		
depending		
on		
the		
outcome		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Obama		
urged		
those		
in		
Ferguson		
to		
"		 
keep		
protests		
peaceful		 
,		 
"		
but		
he		
also		
envisioned		
that		
things		
might		
go		
badly		 
.		 
"		  
You		
know		 
,		
we		
saw		
during		
the		
summer		
the		
possibility		
of		
even		
overwhelmingly		
peaceful		
crowds		
being		
overrun		
by		
a		
few		
thugs		
who		
might		
be		
looking		
for		
an		
excuse		
to		
loot		
or		
to		
commit		
vandalism		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
The		  
president		
said		
he		
had		
spoken		
to		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		
of		
Missouri		
to		
ensure		
that		
he		
had		
a		
plan		
to		
respond		
to		
any		
violence		
and		
"		 
to		
be		
able		
to		
sort		
out		
the		
vast		
majority		
of		
peaceful		
protesters		
form		
the		
handful		
who		
are		
not		 
.		  
"		 
More		
broadly		 
,		
he		
said		 
,		
law		
enforcement		
and		
minority		
communities		
across		
the		
country		
needed		
to		
find		
ways		
to		
deepen		
their		
levels		
of		
trust		 
.		 
Asked		  
whether		
he		
might		
visit		
Ferguson		
once		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
becomes		
public		 
,		
Mr.		
Obama		
said		
he		
would		
"		 
wait		
and		
see		
how		
the		
response		
comes		
about		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
president		
also		
suggested		
that		
he		
might		
keep		
a		
low		
profile		
as		
the		
campaign		
to		
elect		
his		
successor		
geared		
up		 
.		 
"		   
I		
think		
the		
American		
people		 
,		
you		
know		 
,		
they		
're		
going		
to		
want		
--		
you		
know		 
,		
that		
new		
car		
smell		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
"		  
You		
know		 
,		
they		
want		
to		
drive		
something		
off		
the		
lot		
that		
does		
n't		
have		
as		
much		
mileage		
as		
me		 
.		 
"		 
He		  
acknowledged		
that		
Hillary		
Rodham		
Clinton		 
,		
should		
she		
seek		
the		
Democratic		
nomination		
as		
is		
widely		
expected		 
,		
might		
at		
times		
try		
to		
detach		
herself		
from		
his		
record		 
.		 
"		   
She		
's		
not		
going		
to		
agree		
with		
me		
on		
everything		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		
of		
Mrs.		
Clinton		 
,		
his		
former		
secretary		
of		
state		 
.		 
Still		  
,		
he		
said		 
,		
she		
would		
make		
a		
"		 
great		 
"		
president		 
.
