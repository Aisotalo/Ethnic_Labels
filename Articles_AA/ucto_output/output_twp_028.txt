What		  
amazes		
me		
is		
the		
sheer		
number		
of		
people		
sitting		
at		
desks		
miles		
away		
who		
gazed		
into		
the		
news		
from		
Ferguson		
and		
saw		
only		
confirmation		
of		
their		
biases		 
.		 
Every		  
time		
there		
is		
a		
story		
like		
this		
it		
reminds		
me		
of		
the		
tale		
of		
the		
blind		
men		
groping		
at		
an		
elephant		 
.		 
The		 
elephant		 
,		
one		
reported		 
,		
was		
exactly		
like		
a		
tree		
(		 
he		
had		
gotten		
hold		
of		
the		
leg		 
)		 
.		 
The		 
elephant		 
,		
another		
said		 
,		
was		
exactly		
like		
a		
fan		
(		 
he		
had		
the		
ear		 
)

The		 
elephant		 
,		
another		
said

was		
like		
a

he		
'd

trunk

You		 
can		
grab		
the		
same		
thing		
and		
come		
away		
with		
a		
radically		
different		
idea		
of		
it		
eCo		
not		
even		
because		
you		
went		
in		
with		
any		
bias		 
,		
but		
because		
the		
picture		
you		
saw		
was		
incomplete		
and		
you		
framed		
it		
for		
yourself		
as		
best		
you		
could		 
.		 
This		  
story		
is		
not		
about		
the		
media		
or		
about		
the		
Thing		
You		
Want		
It		
To		
Be		
About		 
.		 
This		 
story		
is		
about		
the		
people		
of		
Ferguson		 
.		 
But		  
it		
is		
also		 
,		
a		
little		
bit		
at		
least		 
,		
about		
the		
difference		
between		
looking		
and		
seeing		 
.		 
Ferguson		  
shows		
the		
power		
of		
social		
media		 
.		 
This		 
could		
have		
not		
been		
a		
story		 
.		 
Or		 
it		
could		
have		
just		
been		
a		
local		
story		 
.		 
Or		 
it		
could		
have		
been		
something		
that		
we		
saw		
only		
from		
a		
distance		 
,		
through		
the		
usual		
filters

Instead

it		
gathered		
steam

Read

Look		 
at		
this

No		 
one		
has		
been		
telling		
you		
this		
story		 
.		 
Listen		  
.		 
There		 
have		
been		
clear		
efforts		
by		
the		
police		
in		
Ferguson		
to		
keep		
the		
media		
out		 
.		 
But		 
they		
have		
n't		
succeeded		 
.		 
This		 
became		
a		
national		
story		
both		
because		
and		
in		
spite		
of		
the		
efforts		
to		
shut		
down		
the		
media		 
,		
which		
have		
reinforced		
what		
an		
important		
story		
it		
is		
to		
tell		 
.		 
But		  
there		
are		
many		
ways		
of		
diverting		
attention		
from		
it		 
.		 
And		 
one		
is		
to		
make		
it		
about		
only		
what		
you		
want		
to		
look		
at		 
.		 
The

This		  
story		
is		
not		
about		
the		
media		 
,		
clearly		 
.		 
This		 
is		
n't		
about		
the		
reporters		
(		 
including		
one		
for		
The		
Washington		
Post		 
)		
who		
were		
arrested		 
.		 
It		 
's		
about		
the		
people		
of		
Ferguson		 
.		 
But		 
it		
does		
illustrate		
why		
we		
need		
the		
media		 
:		
to		
tell		
the		
story		
that		
does		
matter		 
.		 
These		 
have		
not		
been		
the		
kindest		
years		
for		
our		
trust		
in		
the		
national		
media		 
.		 
But		 
still		 
,		
when		
people		
are		
trying		
to		
take		
reporters		
into		
custody		
when		
they		
are		
just		
doing		
their		
jobs		 
,		
it		
's		
a		
sign		
that		
something		
is		
wrong		 
.		 
When		 
police		
are		
shutting		
down		
cameras		 
,		
it		
is		
a		
sign		
that		
they		
know		
the		
truth		
is		
not		
going		
to		
be		
kind		
to		
them		 
.		 
It		  
matters		
that		
this		
is		
a		
national		
story		 
.		 
It		 
matters		
that		
the		
media		
are		
there		
to		
capture		
as		
much		
of		
the		
truth		
as		
possible		 
.		 
It		 
is		
possible		
to		
assemble		
a		
narrative		
for		
yourself		 
,		
brokenly		 
,		
on		
social		
media		 
,		
only		
seeing		
what		
you		
want		
to		
look		
at		 
.		 
That		 
the		
Ferguson		
police		
are		
terrified		
of		
a		
media		
presence		
is		
a		
reminder		
of		
how		
much		
that		
presence		
can		
matter		
and		
help		
tell		
an		
important		
story		 
,		
as		
honestly		
as		
possible		 
,		
looking		
at		
everything		 
.		 
We		 
fall		
short		
often		 
.		 
We		 
can		
only		
do		
so		
much		 
.		 
But		 
it		
's		
worth		
striving		
eCo		
to		
look		
at		
everything		 
,		
and		
to		
see
