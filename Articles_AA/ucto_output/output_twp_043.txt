Ferguson		
unrest		 
FERGUSON		   
,		
Mo.		
-		
Missouri		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		
vowed		
on		
Tuesday		
to		
halt		
further		
"		 
lawlessness		 
"		
in		
a		
still-smoldering		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		
as		
residents		
and		
business		
owners		
tried		
to		
make		
sense		
of		
the		
destruction		
that		
has		
followed		
a		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
not		
to		
indict		
a		
police		
officer		
for		
the		
shooting		
death		
of		
unarmed		
teenager		
Michael		
Brown		 
.		 
Nixon		  
said		
more		
than		
2,200		
National		
Guard		
troops		
-		
triple		
the		
number		
from		
a		
night		
earlier		
-		
would		
take		
to		
the		
streets		
to		
prevent		
another		
round		
of		
arson		
and		
rioting		 
.		 
By		 
Tuesday		
evening		 
,		
some		
crowds		
had		
gathered		
in		
parts		
of		
greater		
St.		
Louis		
-		
and		
in		
Atlanta		 
,		
Boston		
and		
several		
other		
American		
cities		
-		
but		
the		
demonstrations		
were		
peaceful		 
.		 
President		  
Barack		
Obama		
criticized		
the		
violence		 
,		
saying		
that		
"		 
nothing		
of		
benefit		 
,		
nothing		
of		
significance		
results		
from		
destructive		
acts		 
.		  
"		 
Speaking		
in		
Chicago		 
,		
Obama		
said		
he		
had		
asked		
Attorney		
General		
Eric		
Holder		
Jr.		
to		
convene		
a		
"		 
series		
of		
regional		
meetings		
focused		
on		
building		
trust		
in		
our		
communities		 
"		
that		
would		
focus		
on		
how		
to		
make		
law		
enforcement		
fairer		 
.		 
The		  
damage		
Monday		
night		
was		
severe		
enough		
that		
several		
of		
Ferguson		
's		
downtown		
blocks		
on		
Tuesday		
were		
designated		
as		
a		
crime		
scene		 
.		 
While		 
Ferguson		
's		
mayor		
and		
Missouri		
's		
lieutenant		
governor		
bristled		
that		
authorities		
had		
n't		
done		
enough		
to		
stop		
the		
rioting		 
,		
others		
said		
the		
destruction		
to		
businesses		
was		
a		
case		
of		
anger		
spiraling		
out		
of		
control		
after		
a		
panel		
of		
jurors		
decided		
not		
to		
indict		
Officer		
Darren		
Wilson		 
.		 
"		   
I		
feel		
like		
I		
could		
collapse		
on		
the		
floor

said		
Kim		
Yeon-sook		 
,		
an		
employee		
at		
the		
half-burned		
and		
looted		
Beauty		
World		 
,		
where		
the		
cash		
register		
was		
missing		
and		
ceiling		
fans		
had		
wilted		
under		
the		
flames		 
.		 
"		   
Oh		
God

a		
friend		
said

hugging

"		  
This		
is		
just

depressing

Since		  
mid-August		 
,		
this		
middle-class		
and		
predominantly		
black		
suburb		
has		
become		
accustomed		
to		
tense		
stand-offs		
between		
police		
and		
protesters		 
.		 
But		 
what		
happened		
Monday		
far		
exceeded		
-		
in		
cost		
and		
damage		
-		
everything		
that		
had		
come		
before		 
,		
and		
it		
left		
Ferguson		
bracing		
for		
further		
waves		
of		
unrest		 
.		 
At		 
least		
a		
half-dozen		
businesses		
were		
torched		
Monday		
alone		 
.		 
Some		 
61		
arrests		
were		
made		 
,		
32		
of		
them		
for		
felony		
charges

At		  
a		
news		
conference		
early		
Tuesday		
afternoon		 
,		
Ferguson		
's		
mayor		 
,		
James		
Knowles		 
,		
criticized		
state		
officials		
for		
not		
doing		
enough		
to		
protect		
property		 
.		 
Though		 
police		
had		
trained		
for		
months		
to		
better		
handle		
mayhem		
and		
Nixon		
a		
week		
earlier		
had		
declared		
a		
state		
of		
emergency		 
,		
the		
National		
Guard		
all		
but		
ignored		
the		
major		
commercial		
areas		
of		
Ferguson		 
,		
running		
along		
both		
South		
and		
West		
Florissant		
avenues

In		  
a		
phone		
interview		 
,		
Missouri		
Lt.		
Gov.		
Peter		
Kinder		
said		
that		
Nixon		
and		
his		
lieutenants		
were		
inaccessible		
Monday		
night		
to		
authorities		
on		
the		
ground		 
,		
including		
Knowles		 
.		 
That		 
led		
to		
a		
situation		
in		
which		
Knowles		
was		
begging		
for		
National		
Guard		
assistance		
but		
could		
n't		
get		
authorization		 
.		 
Knowles		 
and		
Kinder		
spoke		
in		
the		
morning		 
,		
said		
Kinder		 
,		
a		
Republican		
and		
Nixon		
political		
opponent		 
.		 
"		   
It		
is		
dumbfounding		
and		
unfathomable		
that		
a		
governor		
who		
called		
out		
[		 
the		
National		
Guard		 
]		
would		
hold		
them		
back		
at		
a

Kinder		
said		 
,		
practically		
screaming		 
.		 
"		  
Mayor		
Knowles		
sat		
on		
his		
back		
porch		
and		
watched		
businesses		
burn

There		 
are		
12		
businesses		
gone		
today

which		
would		
n't		
be		
the		
case		
if		
there		
had		
been		
50

standing		
in

"		 
Nixon		  
vowed		
at		
a		
news		
conference		
with		
a		
half-dozen		
other		
law		
enforcement		
officials		
that		
there		
"		 
will		
not		
be		
a		
repeat		 
"		
of		
what		
happened		
Monday

Last		
night		
was		
a		
disaster

said		 
.		 
"		  
Criminals		
intent		
on

terrorized		
this

I		 
am		
deeply		
saddened		
for		
the		
people		
of

woke		
up		
this		
morning		
to		
see		
parts		
of		
their		
community		
in		
ruins

"		 
As		  
authorities		
planned		
for		
how		
to		
contain		
Tuesday		
's		
demonstrations

Knowles		
said

about

's		
status		
with

force

The		 
officer

28

has		
been		
on		
administrative		
leave		
since		
the		
shooting		 
,		
though		
Ferguson		
's		
police		
chief		
has		
said		
that

is		
unlikely		
to		
return		
to

job

Officer		  
speaks		
publicly		 
Wilson		  
has		
been		
largely		
out		
of		
public		
view		
during		
that		
time		 
,		
but		
he		
broke		
his		
silence		
Tuesday		
in		
an		
exclusive		
interview		
with		
ABC		
News		 
'		
George		
Stephanopoulos		 
,		
saying		
he		
had		
done		
nothing		
wrong

The		 
officer		
said		
Brown		
had		
charged		
toward		
him		
and		
reached		
into		
his		
squad		
car		
to		
grab		
his		
gun		 
,		
leaving		
him		
no		
choice		
but		
to		
fire		
the		
fatal		
shots		 
.		 
Wilson		 
told		
ABC		
that		
he		
was		
sorry		
that		
Brown		
had		
died		
but		
said		
he		
would		
not		
do		
anything		
differently		
and		
has		
a		
clean		
conscience

Stephanopoulos		  
asked		
whether		
Brown		
's		
hands		
had		
been		
raised

"		  
That		
would		
be		
incorrect

Wilson		
replied

"		  
No		
way

"		 
Meanwhile		   
,		
attorneys		
and		
representatives		
for		
Brown		
's		
family		
took		
aim		
at		
the		
grand		
jury		
proceedings

evidence		
presented

flawed

They		 
also		
called		
the		
decision

release		
the

jury

findings		
at		
night		
irresponsible		 
.		 
"		  
It		
was		
unnecessarily		
provocative		 
,

I		
think		
it		
only		
cleared		
up		
why

the		
Rev.		
Al		
Sharpton

Holder		   
,		
meeting		
with		
reporters		
Tuesday		
afternoon		 
,		
expressed		
his		
disappointment		
in		
the		
outbreak		
of		
violence		
and		
said		
the		
Justice

would		
seek		
to		
determine

was		
responsible

independent

A

angry

Tuesday		  
morning

hundreds

assembled		
downtown

cleaning		
up

girding

swept
