and

Scrutiny		 
Police		  
departments		
around		
the		
country		
are		
racing		
to		
develop		
new		
training		
rules		
on		
the		
use		
of		
force		 
,		
a		
response		
that		
has		
gained		
urgency		
amid		
scrutiny		
from		
the		
U.S.		
Justice		
Department		
and		
an		
emerging		
consensus		
that		
law-enforcement		
practices		
need		
to		
be		
reviewed		
and		
revamped		 
.		 
In		  
many		
cases		 
,		
departments		
are		
grappling		
with		
how		
to		
prevent		
encounters		
between		
police		
and		
citizens		
from		
escalating		
into		
deadly		
ones		 
,		
especially		
with		
minorities		 
,		
as		
was		
the		
case		
in		
two		
deaths		
that		
have		
sparked		
nationwide		
civil-rights		
protests		 
.		 
Those		 
protests		
continued		
Thursday		
with		
demonstrators		
gathering		
and		
chanting		
for		
change		
in		
New		
York		 
,		
Washington		 
,		
and		
elsewhere		 
.		 
Over		  
the		
past		
10		
days		 
,		
separate		
grand		
juries		
decided		
not		
to		
indict		
white		
police		
officers		
in		
the		
deaths		
of		
unarmed		
black		
men		 
.		 
In		 
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
,		
former		
officer		
Darren		
Wilson		
was		
n't		
indicted		
in		
the		
fatal		
August		
shooting		
of		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
and		
New		
York		
City		
officer		
Daniel		
Pantaleo		
was		
n't		
indicted		
in		
the		
July		
death		
of		
Eric		
Garner		
following		
an		
apparent		
chokehold		 
.		 
On		  
Thursday		 
,		
Attorney		
General		
Eric		
Holder		
said		
a		
Justice		
Department		
probe		
had		
concluded		
the		
Cleveland		
Division		
of		
Police		
has		
a		
pattern		
of		
using		
excessive		
force		 
,		
both		
in		
firing		
weapons		
and		
in		
using		
nondeadly		
techniques

to		
an		
outside

A		  
bipartisan		
coalition		
of		
lawmakers		
said		
Congress		
should		
examine		
police		
tactics		
and		
the		
criminal-justice		
system		 
,		
a		
moment		
that		
unites		
Democrats		
with		
the		
libertarian		
wing		
of		
the		
Republican		
Party		 
,		
which		
in		
particular		
has		
emerged		
as		
critical		
of		
law		
enforcement		 
.		 
"		   
Clearly		
both		
of		
these		
are		
serious		
tragedies		
that		
we		
've		
seen		
in		
our		
society

I		
think		
the		
American		
people		
want		
to		
understand		
more

the		
facts		
were

million		
initiative		
to

its		
35,000

They		 
said		
the		
training		
is		
designed		
to		
change		
how		
officers		
talk		
with

listen		
to		
residents

and		
to		
help		
officers		
defuse		
volatile		
situations

use		
less		
force		
when		
possible

you		
are		
going

see		
a		
very		
different

after		
this		
training

been		
achieved

Mr.

which		
represents		
335,000		
officers		 
,		
said		
the		
law-enforcement		
community		
has		
already		
begun		
trying		
to		
address		
some		
concerns		 
.		 
In		 
November		 
,		
the		
organization		
contacted		
about		
120		
of		
its		
leaders		
and		
recommended		
they		
start		
formulating		
plans		
with

be		
implemented

While		  
not		
discussing		
specific		
incidents

Mr.

said		
there		
are		
times		
when		
officers		
make		
mistakes		
and		
some		
may		
not		
have		
the		
best		
intentions

he		
said

are		
trying		
to		
do		
the		
job		
right

I		
do

he		
said

on		
the		
other

I

New

had		
started		
to		
take		
steps		
to		
address		
issues		
raised		
by		
the		
Garner		
incident		 
,		
including		
changing		
how		
officers		
are		
trained		
in		
the		
use		
of		
force

emphasizing		
discretion

The

also		
embraced		
a		
push		
to		
outfit		
officers		
with		
body		
cameras

launching		
a		
pilot		
program		
this		
week		
in		
three		
precincts

plans		
for		
a		
wider		
rollout		
sometime		
in

Some		  
police		
departments		
are		
taking		
a		
closer		
look		
at		
behavior		
that		
might		
prompt		
a		
confrontation

After		 
a

police		
officer		
shot

ill		
black		
man

grabbed		
his

Chief		
Edward		
Flynn		
fired		
the		
officer		
not		
for

for		
what		
he		
allegedly		
did		
before

conducting		
an		
improper		
pat-down

up

the		
use

assessed		
at
