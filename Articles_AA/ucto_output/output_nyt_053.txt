On		  
Rooftops		
of		
Ferguson		 
,		
Volunteers

With

FERGUSON		   
,		
Mo.		
--		
When		
Sam		
Andrews		
awoke		
on		
Tuesday		
morning		 
,		
he		
found		
his		
wife		
watching		
a		
television		
interview		
with		
a		
woman		
whose		
bakery		
had		
been		
vandalized		
during		
the		
violent		
unrest		
here		
on		
Monday		 
.		 
"		   
She		
said		 
,		
'		 
You		
've		
got		
to		
go		
help		
her		 
,		 
'		
"		
Mr.		
Andrews		
said		
in		
an		
interview		
on		
Saturday		
morning		 
.		 
And		  
so		
Mr.		
Andrews		 
,		
a		
former		
Defense		
Department		
contractor		
who		
is		
now		
a		
weapons		
engineer		
in		
the		
St.		
Louis		
area		 
,		
set		
to		
work		 
.		 
Under		 
the		
auspices		
of		
a		
national		
group		
called		
the		
Oath		
Keepers		 
,		
Mr.		
Andrews		
accelerated		
plans		
to		
recruit		
and		
organize		
private		
security		
details		
for		
businesses		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
which		
are		
receiving		
the		
services		
for		
free		 
.		 
The		 
volunteers		 
,		
who		
are		
sometimes		
described		
as		
a		
citizen		
militia		
--		
but		
do		
not		
call		
themselves		
that		
--		
have		
taken		
up		
armed		
positions		
on		
rooftops		
here		
on		
recent		
nights		 
.		 
"		   
It		
's		
really		
a		
broad		
group		
of		
citizens		 
,		
and		
I		
'm		
sure		
their		
motivations		
are		
all		
different		 
,		 
"		
said		
Mr.		
Andrews		 
,		
who		
is		
in		
his		
50		 
s		 
.		 
"		  
In		
many		
of		
them		 
,		
there		
's		
probably		
a		
sense		
of		
patriotism		 
.		 
But		 
I		
think		
in		
most		
of		
them		 
,		
there		
's		
probably		
something		
that		
they		
probably		
do		
n't		
even		
recognize		 
:		
that		
we		
have		
a		
moral		
obligation		
to		
protect		
the		
weakest		
among		
us		 
.		 
When		 
we		
see		
these		
violent		
people		 
,		
these		
arsonists		
and		
anarchists		 
,		
attacking		 
,		
it		
just		
pokes		
at		
you		
in		
a		
deep		
place		 
.		 
"		 
Mr.		  
Andrews		
declined		
to		
say		
how		
many		
people		
were		
assisting		
in		
the		
effort		 
,		
saying		
only		
that		
the		
number		
was		
"		 
more		
than		
five		 
,		
less		
than		
500		 
.		  
"		 
He		
estimated		
that		
men		
make		
up		
about		
80		
percent		
of		
the		
volunteers		 
.		 
About		 
80		
percent		
are		
white		 
,		
and		
10		
percent		
are		
black		 
.		 
But		  
on		
Saturday		 
,		
with		
the		
county		
police		
said		
to		
be		
threatening		
the		
Oath		
Keepers		
with		
arrest		 
,		
the		
volunteers		
decided		
to		
abandon		
their		
posts		
and		
instead		
protest		
against		
the		
authorities		 
.		 
During		 
the		
evening		 
,		
Mr.		
Andrews		
and		
some		
of		
his		
colleagues		
appeared		
on		
South		
Florissant		
Road		 
,		
conducting		
a		
protest		
of		
their		
own		 
.		 
They		 
ate		
pizza		
and		
stood		
beneath		
a		
handmade		
sign		
critical		
of		
Chief		
Jon		
Belmar		
of		
the		
St.		
Louis		
County		
police		 
.		 
Just		  
after		
8:30	TIME	
p		 
.		 
m		 
.		  
,		 
those		
protesting		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
death		
crossed		
paths		
with		
the		
Oath		
Keepers		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Andrews		
shook		
hands		
with		
the		
demonstrators		 
,		
many		
of		
whom		
have		
also		
been		
critical		
of		
Chief		
Belmar		 
.		 
That		  
some		
business		
owners		
accepted		
aid		
from		
a		
group		
regarded		
by		
some		
as		
an		
antigovernment		
militia		
is		
a		
testament		
to		
the		
rawness		
of		
emotions		
here		
following		
a		
riot		
on		
Monday		
night		 
,		
after		
a		
grand		
jury		
declined		
to		
indict		
a		
white		
police		
officer		 
,		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
who		
shot		
to		
death		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		 
,		
on		
Aug.		
9		 
.		 
Since		  
then		 
,		
the		
riot		
police		
have		
tussled		
on		
the		
streets		
with		
protesters		 
.		 
Convoys		 
of		
National		
Guard		
Humvees		
patrol		
the		
streets		 
,		
and		
law		
enforcement		
officials		
have		
confiscated		
guns		 
,		
firecrackers		
and		
homemade		
firebombs		
from		
arrested		
protesters		 
.		 
The		 
Oath		
Keepers		 
,		
equipped		
with		
militia-style		
gear		
and		
often		
clad		
in		
camouflage		 
,		
have		
joined		
the		
volatile		
mix		 
.		 
Their		  
presence		
is		
a		
symbol		
of		
the		
continuing		
criticism		
of		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		
's		
handling		
of		
security		
before		
and		
after		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
became		
public		 
.		 
In		 
the		
days		
before		
the		
announcement		 
,		
Mr.		
Nixon		
declared		
a		
state		
of		
emergency		
and		
sent		
the		
Guard		
to		
Ferguson		 
.		 
Yet		  
,		
in		
the		
initial		
hours		
following		
word		
of		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		 
,		
the		
Guard		
played		
only		
a		
limited		
role		 
.		 
Troops		 
protected		
a		
police		
command		
post		
and		
other		
facilities		 
,		
but		
they		
were		
not		
posted		
along		
the		
main		
commercial		
corridors		
where		
property		
destruction		
was		
rampant		 
.		 
"		   
The		
governor		
said		
himself		 
,		
I		
think		
on		
TV		 
,		
that		
the		
businesses		
will		
be		
protected		
by		
the		
National		
Guard		
during		
this		
situation		 
,		 
"		
said		
Reggie		
Jones		 
,		
the		
mayor		
of		
Dellwood		 
,		
a		
neighboring		
city		
where		
many		
businesses		
were		
damaged		
in		
Monday		
's		
unrest		 
.		 
"		  
Unfortunately		 
,		
that		
did		
not		
happen		
until		
Tuesday		 
.		 
But		 
we		
were		
expecting		
it		
to		
happen		
on		
Monday		 
.		 
"		 
After		  
the		
destruction		
that		
night		 
,		
Mr.		
Nixon		
ordered		
hundreds		
more		
soldiers		
to		
Ferguson		 
,		
saying		 
,		
"		 
We		
must		
do		
better		 
,		
and		
we		
will		 
.		 
"		 
But		  
for		
people		
like		
Mr.		
Andrews		 
,		
the		
governor		
's		
vow		
was		
of		
little		
solace		 
.		 
So		 
while		
the		
New		
Chinese		
Gourmet		
restaurant		
at		
the		
end		
of		
a		
block		
of		
South		
Florissant		
Road		
appears		
to		
have		
little		
in		
the		
way		
of		
defense		
beyond		
the		
painted		
wooden		
boards		
that		
cover		
its		
windows		 
,		
armed		
men		
and		
women		
on		
recent		
nights		
have		
roamed		
the		
rooftop		
it		
shares		
with		
a		
dental		
practice		
and		
a		
law		
office		 
.		 
"		   
When		
they		
're		
here		 
,		
there		
's		
definitely		
a		
weight		
lifted		
off		
of		
our		
shoulders		 
,		 
"		
said		
Davis		
Vo		 
,		
whose		
family		
owns		
New		
Chinese		
Gourmet		 
.		 
"		  
I		
'd		
be		
lying		
if		
I		
said		
otherwise		 
.		 
"		 
On		  
its		
website		 
,		
Oath		
Keepers		
released		
a		
recruiting		
message		
to		
"		 
all		
skilled		
veterans		
and		
patriots		 
"		
and		
asked		
them		
to		
"		 
grab		
your		
gear		
and		
start		
rolling		
toward		
Ferguson		 
.		  
"		 
The		
post		
listed		
nine		
types		
of		
people		
the		
group		
was		
seeking		 
,		
including		
paramedics		 
,		
police		
officers		 
,		
"		 
private		
drone		
operators		 
"		
and		
videographers		
who		
could		
"		 
film		
any		
encounters		
with		
looters		 
.		 
"		 
Mr.		  
Andrews		
said		
he		
researched		
the		
qualifications		
of		
each		
volunteer		 
,		
as		
well		
as		
whether		
any		
might		
have		
racially		
based		
motivations		
to		
participate		 
.		 
"		   
I		
do		
n't		
want		
any		
racists		
in		
my		
group		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
"		  
I		
do		
n't		
want		
any		
people		
who		
want		
to		
visit		
violence		
on		
any		
group		 
.		 
I		 
only		
want		
professionals		
with		
real		
credentials		
that		
can		
be		
verified		
and		
have		
experience		
in		
dealing		
with		
violence		 
.		 
"		 
But		  
the		
St.		
Louis		
County		
police		 
,		
Mr.		
Andrews		
said		 
,		
and		
other		
law		
enforcement		
officials		
have		
expressed		
misgivings		 
.		 
"		   
When		
we		
hear		
information		
that		
someone		 
,		
or		
a		
group		 
,		
is		
providing		
security		
without		
a		
license		 
,		
our		
department		
has		
to		
investigate		
the		
issue		 
,		 
"		
a		
police		
spokesman		 
,		
Shawn		
McGuire		 
,		
said		
in		
an		
email		
on		
Saturday		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Andrews		
said		
that		
the		
warning		
on		
Friday		
was		
tantamount		
to		
a		
temporary		
shutdown		
order		 
,		
and		
he		
said		
he		
did		
not		
expect		
his		
volunteers		
to		
defy		
it		 
.
