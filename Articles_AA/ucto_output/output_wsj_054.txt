Law		  
and		
Protest		
in		
New		
York		 
New		  
York		
City		
was		
on		
edge		
as		
we		
went		
to		
press		
last		
night		 
,		
hoping		
that		
it		
does		
n't		
turn		
into		
another		
Ferguson		 
,		
Missouri		 
,		
in		
the		
wake		
of		
a		
Staten		
Island		
grand		
jury		
decision		
not		
to		
indict		
a		
police		
officer		
for		
the		
death		
of		
a		
black		
man		
who		
was		
restrained		
in		
a		
chokehold		
in		
July		 
.		 
As		  
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
the		
public		
pressure		
to		
indict		
officer		
Daniel		
Pantaleo		
has		
been		
heavy		
--		
exacerbated		
by		
a		
video		
that		
showed		
the		
scuffle		
in		
which		
43		 
-		
year-old		
Eric		
Garner		
could		
be		
heard		
saying		
"		 
I		
ca		
n't		
breathe		 
.		  
"		 
Officers		
were		
trying		
to		
arrest		
him		
for		
allegedly		
selling		
untaxed		
cigarettes		
--		
a		
booming		
black-market		
business		
in		
the		
heavily		
taxed		
Big		
Apple		 
.		 
The		  
video		
is		
troubling		 
,		
but		
we		
are		
n't		
about		
to		
join		
those		
questioning		
the		
grand		
jury		
members		
who		
spent		
two		
months		
hearing		
from		
22		
civilian		
witnesses		
and		
sifting		
through		
evidence		
that		
we		
have		
n't		
seen		 
.		 
The		 
Staten		
Island		
prosecutor		
said		
he		
would		
seek		
a		
court		
order		
allowing		
him		
to		
release		
some		
information		
in		
the		
case		 
,		
which		
would		
typically		
remain		
secret		
under		
New		
York		
law		 
.		 
In		 
any		
case		
the		
public		
has		
to		
trust		
the		
legal		
process		
or		
America		
is		
going		
to		
become		
a		
much		
more		
rancorous		
and		
violent		
country		 
.		 
This		  
is		
also		
a		
case		
in		
which		
doubters		
ca		
n't		
blame		
the		
racial		
makeup		
of		
the		
New		
York		
Police		
Department		 
,		
which		
is		
broadly		
representative		
of		
the		
city		 
.		 
According		 
to		
the		
2010		
Census		 
,		
New		
York		
is		
45		 
%		
white		 
,		
27		 
%		
Hispanic		
and		
25		 
%		
black		 
.		 
The		 
NYPD		
's		
unformed		
ranks		
are		
roughly		
52		 
%		
white		 
,		
27		 
%		
Hispanic		
and		
16		 
%		
black		 
.		 
Racial		 
tensions		
do		
n't		
explain		
every		
or		
even		
most		
cases		
in		
which		
police		
take		
violent		
action		 
.		 
That		  
wo		
n't		
deter		
racial		
provocateurs		
like		
Al		
Sharpton		 
,		
who		
from		
the		
beginning		
has		
compared		
Garner		
's		
case		
to		
that		
of		
Michael		
Brown		
in		
Ferguson		 
.		 
He		 
's		
also		
promised		
demonstrations		 
,		
and		
self-styled		
anarchists		
are		
only		
too		
eager		
to		
exploit		
them		
for		
violent		
ends		 
.		 
New		 
York		
police		
broke		
up		
a		
plot		
to		
disrupt		
the		
Macy		
's		
Thanksgiving		
Day		
parade		
in		
the		
wake		
of		
the		
Ferguson		
grand		
jury		
decision		 
.		 
We		  
ca		
n't		
say		
the		
politicians		
have		
been		
all		
that		
helpful		 
.		 
While		 
they		
issued		
their		
ritual		
calls		
to		
avoid		
violence		 
,		
the		
tenor		
of		
their		
comments		
have		
fed		
the		
post-Ferguson		
liberal		
narrative		
that		
the		
police		
are		
typically		
at		
fault		 
.		 
New		 
York		
Governor		
Andrew		
Cuomo		
called		
for		
"		 
respect		 
"		
for		
"		 
the		
legal		
process		 
,		 
"		
but		
he		
also		
suggested		
that		
"		 
additional		
investigations		
and		
reviews		 
"		
may		
be		
appropriate		 
,		
including		
by		
the		
feds		 
.		 
So		 
he		
really		
does		
n't		
trust		
New		
York		
's		
legal		
process		 
.		 
President		  
Obama		
also		
seemed		
to		
put		
the		
onus		
on		
police		
by		
immediately		
linking		
the		
Garner		
tragedy		
to		
"		 
concern		
on		
the		
part		
of		
too		
many		
minority		
communities		
that		
law		
enforcement		
is		
not		
working		
with		
them		
and		
dealing		
with		
them		
in		
a		
fair		
way		 
.		  
"		 
He		
added		
that		
"		 
when		
anybody		
in		
this		
country		
is		
not		
being		
treated		
equally		
under		
the		
law		 
,		
that		
's		
a		
problem		 
.		 
And		 
it		
's		
my		
job		
as		
President		
to		
try		
to		
solve		
it		 
.		 
"		 
That		  
's		
true		 
,		
but		
in		
this		
case		
it		
was		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
job		
to		
determine		
if		
the		
police		
officer		
committed		
a		
crime		 
,		
and		
a		
President		
's		
first		
obligation		
is		
to		
uphold		
the		
law		 
.		 
In		 
these		
difficult		
weeks		 
,		
he		
should		
be		
urging		
above		
all		
that		
Americans		
respect		
the		
legal		
process		 
.
