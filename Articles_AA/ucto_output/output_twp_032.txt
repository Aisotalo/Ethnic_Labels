FERGUSON		   
,		
Missouri		
-		
A		
grand		
jury		
on		
Monday		
declined		
to		
indict		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
the		
white		
Ferguson		 
,		
Missouri		 
,		
police		
officer		
whose		
fatal		
shooting		
of		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		
sparked		
days		
of		
turbulent		
protests		
and		
a		
national		
conversation		
about		
race		
and		
police		
interactions		
with		
AfricanAmerican		 
.		 
The		  
decision		
means		
that		
Wilson		 
,		
28		 
,		
will		
face		
no		
state		
charges		
in		
the		
August		
shooting		
death		
of		
18		 
-		
year-old		
Michael		
Brown		 
.		 
Although		 
a		
parallel		
federal		
civil		
rights		
investigation		
of		
the		
shooting		
is		
continuing		 
,		
federal		
investigators		
have		
all		
but		
concluded		
that		
they		
do		
not		
have		
a		
case		
against		
Wilson		 
,		
either		 
,		
law		
enforcement		
officials		
have		
said		 
.		 
St.		  
Louis		
County		
prosecutor		
Robert		
McCulloch		
told		
an		
evening		
news		
conference		
that		
the		
grand		
jury		 
,		
which		
deliberated		
for		
more		
than		
two		
days		 
,		
found		
no		
probable		
cause		
to		
bring		
charges		
against		
Wilson		 
.		 
"		   
The		
duty		
of		
the		
grand		
jury		
is		
to		
separate		
fact		
from		
fiction		 
,		 
"		
McCulloch		
said		 
.		 
While		  
a		
separate		
federal		
probe		
of		
the		
Ferguson		
Police		
Department		
is		
underway		 
,		
the		
prospect		
that		
Wilson		
will		
face		
no		
direct		
legal		
consequences		
for		
Brown		
's		
death		
was		
expected		
to		
trigger		
protests		
in		
the		
St.		
Louis		
area		
and		
nationwide		 
.		 
Shortly		  
before		
the		
decision		
was		
announced		 
,		
Missouri		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		 
,		
D		 
,		
issued		
an		
urgent		
plea		
for		
calm		 
.		 
He		 
expressed		
the		
hope		
that		
"		 
regardless		
of		
the		
decision		 
,		
people		
on		
all		
sides		
show		
tolerance		 
,		
mutual		
respect		 
,		
and		
restraint		 
.		  
"		 
Saying		
he		
had		
visited		
Monday		
with		
Ferguson		
residents		 
,		
Nixon		
said		 
,		
"		 
It		
's		
understandable		
that		
like		
the		
rest		
of		
us		 
,		
they		
are		
on		
edge		
waiting		
for		
the		
decision		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
governor		
made		
clear		
that		
acts		
of		
violence		
will		
not		
be		
tolerated		 
.		 
"		  
We		
are		
making		
sure		
that		
the		
necessary		
resources		
are		
on		
hand		
to		
protect		
lives		 
,		
to		
protect		
property		
and		
to		
protect		
free		
speech		 
,		
he		
said		
at		
a		
news		
conference		 
,		
adding		
that		
he		
has		
deployed		
the		
Missouri		
National		
Guard		
to		
provide		
security		
at		
police		
stations		 
,		
fire		
houses		
and		
utility		
substations		 
.		 
St.		  
Louis		
County		
Executive		
Charlie		
Dooley		
made		
a		
similar		
appeal		
for		
protesters		
to		
remain		
peaceful		 
.		 
"		  
I		
want		
people		
to		
think		
with		
their		
heads		
and		
not		
their		
emotions		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
Officials		  
have		
discussed		
emergency		
plans		
in		
the		
event		
of		
a		
violent		
reaction		 
,		
while		
protest		
organizers		
and		
community		
leaders		
have		
mapped		
out		
their		
response		
in		
the		
hopes		
of		
avoiding		
the		
unrest		
that		
exploded		
after		
Brown		
was		
killed		 
.		 
The		  
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
had		
been		
expected		 
,		
and		
it		
was		
yet		
another		
turn		
in		
a		
case		
marked		
in		
the		
national		
consciousness		
by		
the		
images		
of		
protesters		
looting		
stores		
and		
police		
wearing		
riot		
gear		
and		
deploying		
tear		
gas		
in		
the		
days		
after		
Brown		
's		
death		 
.		 
Details		 
of		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
deliberations		
had		
leaked		
out		
in		
recent		
weeks		 
,		
angering		
the		
Brown		
family		
and		
protesters		
who		
saw		
it		
as		
a		
signal		
that		
there		
would		
be		
no		
charges		
filed		 
.		 
The		  
end		
of		
the		
state		
investigation		
came		
amid		
growing		
tensions		
in		
recent		
days		
between		
state		
and		
federal		
authorities		 
,		
with		
Attorney		
General		
Eric		
Holder		
privately		
expressing		
his		
displeasure		
over		
the		
way		
Missouri		
handled		
the		
run-up		
to		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		 
.		 
Nixon		 
had		
declared		
a		
state		
of		
emergency		
and		
activated		
the		
National		
Guard		 
,		
which		
prompted		
a		
top		
Holder		
aide		
to		
call		
the		
governor		
's		
office		
and		
indicate		
that		
the		
move		
may		
have		
escalated		
tensions		 
,		
officials		
said		 
.		 
Wilson		  
has		
been		
on		
paid		
leave		
since		
the		
shooting		 
,		
and		
Ferguson		
Police		
Chief		
Thomas		
Jackson		
said		
Thursday		
that		
the		
six-year		
officer		
was		
unlikely		
to		
return		
to		
work		 
,		
regardless		
of		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		 
.		 
That		 
reversed		
the		
chief		
's		
earlier		
declaration		
that		
the		
officer		
would		
be		
welcomed		
back		
if		
he		
was		
not		
indicted		 
.		 
Wilson		  
has		
not		
been		
seen		
in		
public		
since		
Brown		
's		
death		 
,		
and		
few		
details		
about		
his		
life		
have		
emerged		 
.		 
His		 
representatives		
had		
no		
immediate		
comment		
on		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		 
.		 
The		 
officer		
reportedly		
testified		
before		
the		
grand		
jury		
and		
spoke		
with		
federal		
and		
local		
investigators

Canfield		
Drive		
in

blocks		
from		
the		
apartment		
of		
the		
teenager

The		  
panel		
of		
grand		
jurors		
convened		
in		
mid-August		 
,		
days		
after		
the		
shooting		 
,		
and		
spent		
weeks		
considering		
the		
case		 
.		 
Discussions		 
could		
have		
stretched		
even		
longer		 
;		
the		
group		
had		
been		
granted		
an		
extension		
through		
early		
January		 
.		 
Impatience		  
and		
pressure		
for		
a		
decision		
had		
been		
building		
among		
residents		
and		
business		
owners		 
,		
as		
well		
as		
police		
officers		 
,		
who		
have		
been		
working		
12

hour		
shifts		
with		
all		
leave

canceled		
since		
Saturday

said		
Jeff		
Roorda		 
,		
business		
manager		
for		
the		
St.

Association		 
.		 
That		 
schedule		
will		
continue		
through		
the		
aftermath		
of		
the		
grand		
jury		
decision		 
.		 
The		  
closed-door		
grand		
jury		
process		 
,		
much		
like		
the		
initial		
investigation		 
,		
has		
been		
controversial		
throughout		 
.		 
In		 
early		
October		 
,		
for		
example		 
,		
allegations		
of		
misconduct		
arose		
after		
a		
Twitter		
user		
wrote		
that		
a		
friend		
sat		
on		
the		
panel		
and		
did		
not		
think		
there		
was		
enough		
evidence		
to		
arrest		
the		
officer		 
.		 
(		  
The		
woman		
later		
said		
she		
had		
been		
hacked		 
.		 
)		 
In		  
recent		
weeks		 
,		
the		
most		
vocal		
protesters		
and		
local		
organizers		
have		
insisted		
that		
they		
never		
believed		
Wilson		
would		
face		
charges		 
.		 
"		  
It		
's		
not		
if		
the		
officer		
is		
n't		
indicted		 
,		 
"		
protest		
organizer		
Dhoruba		
Shakur		
said		
during		
an		
interview		
in		
early		
October		 
.		 
"		  
It		
's		
when		 
.		 
There		 
will		
be		
no		
indictment

We		 
know		
that

"		 
The		  
Justice		
Department		
's		
civil		
rights		
investigation		
was		
announced		
days		
after		
the		
shooting		 
,		
with		
Holder		
traveling		
to		
Ferguson		 
,		
where		
National		
Guard		
troops		
had		
been		
deployed		
amid		
the		
increasingly		
chaotic		
aftermath		 
.		 
In		 
early		
September		 
,		
Holder		
announced		
that		
the		
department		
also		
would		
review		
the		
Ferguson		
Police		
Department		 
,		
investigating		
claims		
that		
officers		
might		
have		
engaged		
in		
a		
pattern		
of		
racial		
profiling		
or		
excessive		
force		 
.		 
"		   
Anecdotal		
accounts		
underscore		
the		
history		
of		
mistrust		
of

enforcement		
in		
Ferguson

Holder		
said

"		  
As		
a		
result		
of		
this		
history		 
,		
and		
following		
an		
extensive		
review		
of		
documented		
allegations		
and		
other		
available		
data		 
,		
we		
have		
determined		
that		
there		
is		
cause		
for		
the		
Justice		
Department		
to		
open		
an		
investigation		 
.		 
"		 
After		  
the		
fatal		
shooting		 
,		
protesters		
responded		
by		
gathering		
in		
the		
streets		
of		
Ferguson		 
,		
calling		
for		
justice		
in		
the		
Brown		
case		
and		
broad		
reform		
on		
a		
municipal		
level		 
.		 
Hundreds		 
spent		
their		
August		
nights		
following		
grainy		
live-stream		
feeds		
from		
West		
Florissant		
Avenue		 
,		
as		
activists		
and		
residents		
were		
hit		
with		
tear		
gas		
and		
police		
in		
riot		
gear		
flooded		
the		
streets		 
.		 
Many		 
who		
were		
arrested		
later		
claimed		
they		
had		
done		
nothing		
to		
prompt		
police		
action		
and		
questioned		
law		
enforcement		
's		
response		
to		
the		
unrest		 
.		 
Authorities		  
defended		
their		
actions		 
,		
saying		
they		
were		
trying		
to		
keep		
order		
while		
respecting		
the		
public		
's		
right		
to		
protest		 
.		 
Clashes		  
continued		
throughout		
October		 
,		
occasionally		
spilling		
out		
of		
the		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		
where		
Brown		
was		
killed

during		
a		
Rams		
game		
at		
the		
Edward		
Jones		
Dome		 
.		 
Early		  
on		 
,		
there		
were		
calls		
for		
McCulloch		 
,		
the		
St.		
Louis		
County		
prosecutor		 
,		
to		
step		
down		
from		
the		
case

Activists		  
,		
troubled		
by		
McCulloch		
's		
personal		
and		
professional		
ties		
to		
law		
enforcement		 
,		
demanded		
a		
special		
prosecutor		 
.		 
But		 
Nixon		
would		
n't		
ask		
McCulloch		
to		
recuse		
himself		 
,		
and		
McCulloch		
declined		
to		
step		
aside

"

stated		
repeatedly

McCulloch		
said		
in

"		 
Ferguson		  
officials		
announced		
in		
September		
that		
they		
would		
make		
changes		
to		
a		
number		
of		
municipal		
fines		
and		
fees		 
,		
which		
many		
said		
unfairly		
targeted

The		 
city		
got		
rid		
of

administrative		
charge		
for		
towing		
vehicles

said		
it		
would		
start		
a		
citizen		
review		
board

decided		
to		
tweak

court		
procedures

nearly		
seven		
weeks		
after		
the		
shooting

taped		
statement

Jackson		 
later		
tried		
to		
join		
in		
protests		
outside		
his		
own		
department

an		
ill-fated		
effort		
that		
only		
led		
to		
more		
clashes		 
.		 
Brown		  
's		
shooting		
triggered		
a		
national		
debate		
about		
race		 
,		
in		
part		
because		
it		
followed		
a		
string		
of		
incidents		
in		
which		
black		
men		
were		
killed		
under		
controversial		
circumstances		 
.		 
In		 
July

was		
killed		
in		
New

when		
an		
officer		
put		
the		
43

year-old		
man		
in		
a		
chokehold

The		  
events		
that		
precipitated

for

who		
witnessed

has		
said		
that

was		
the		
aggressor		
as

encounter		
escalated

contended

struggled		
with
