From		  
Mayberry		
to		
Ferguson		 
,		
the		
rise		
of		
the		
modern		
cop		 
Last		  
night		 
,		
I		
tuned		
in		
to		
the		
livestream		
of		
the		
events		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Missouri		 
,		
where		
police		
mounted		
a		
disproportionate		
and		
militant		
response		
to		
protesters		
who		
were		
asking		
for		
answers		
about		
the		
death		
of		
18		 
-		
year-old		
Mike		
Brown		 
,		
who		
was		
killed		
by		
an		
officer		 
.		 
This		 
morning		 
,		
I		
looked		
in		
a		
very		
different		
direction		 
,		
to		
"		 
The		
Andy		
Griffith		
Show		 
,		 
"		
which		
debuted		
on		
CBS		
in		
1960		
and		
starred		
Andy		
Griffith		
as		
Mayberry		
's		
Sheriff		
Andy		
Taylor		 
.		 
The		  
gap		
between		
Ferguson		
and		
Mayberry		
is		
striking		
and		
important		 
.		 
As		 
my		
colleagues		
have		
reported		 
,		
Ferguson		
's		
overwhelmingly		
white		
police		
force		
"		 
bears		
little		
demographic		
resemblance		
to		
the		
citizens		
of		
this		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		 
,		
a		
mostly		
AfricanAmerican		
community		
whose		
suspicions		
of		
the		
law		
enforcement		
agency		
preceded		
Saturday		
afternoon		
's		
shooting		 
.		 
"		 
Even		  
when		
it		
began		 
,		
executives		
acknowledged		
that		
"		 
The		
Andy		
Griffith		
Show		 
"		
was		
a		
nostalgic		
portrait		
of		
small-town		
life		 
.		 
But		 
it		
expressed		
an		
ideal		
that		
has		
leached		
out		
of		
American		
pop		
culture		
and		
public		
policy		 
,		
to		
dangerous		
effect		 
:		
that		
the		
police		
were		
part		
of		
the		
communities		
that		
they		
served		
and		
shared		
their		
fellow		
citizens		 
'		
interests		 
.		 
They		 
were		
of		
their		
towns		
and		
cities		 
,		
not		
at		
war		
with		
them		 
.		 
Much		  
of		
the		
crime-related		
tension		
in		
"		 
The		
Andy		
Griffith		
Show		 
"		
comes		
from		
the		
contrast		
between		
what		
people		
think		
real		
police		
work		
is		
and		
what		
the		
Sheriff		
knows		
it		
to		
be		 
.		 
In		 
the		
pilot		
episode		
of		
the		
sitcom		 
,		
the		
only		
crime		
is		
a		
case		
of		
jaywalking		
by		
an		
elderly		
woman		 
,		
brought		
in		
by		
Taylor		
's		
overzealous		
deputy		 
,		
Barney		
Fife		
(		 
Don		
Knotts		 
)		 
.		 
In		  
another		
episode		 
,		
a		
manhunt		
for		
an		
escaped		
criminal		
brings		
higher		
authorities		
to		
town		 
.		 
Barney		 
frets		 
:		
"		 
What		
are		
the		
state		
police		
going		
to		
think		
when		
they		
come		
here		
and		
find		
we		
got		
an		
empty		
jail		 
?		 
They		 
're		
gonna		
we		
're		
just		
a		
hick		
town		
where		
nothing		
ever		
happens		 
!		  
"		 
For		
Barney		 
,		
the		
welfare		
of		
the		
community		
is		
an		
abstraction		
compared		
with		
his		
idealized		
sense		
of		
what		
it		
means		
to		
be		
a		
cop		 
.		 
Sheriff		  
Taylor		
ultimately		
outsmarts		
the		
overreaching		
state		
cops		
to		
catch		
the		
fugitive		 
.		 
He		 
knows		
his		
town		
well		
enough		
to		
guess		
which		
back		
road		
the		
fugitive		
might		
use		 
,		
to		
read		
the		
concern		
in		
an		
elderly		
woman		
's		
voice		
and		
to		
direct		
the		
wanted		
man		
to		
a		
leaky		
row		
boat		
as		
an		
escape		
vessel		 
,		
enabling		
the		
state		
police		
to		
pick		
him		
up		
without		
firing		
a		
shot		 
.		 
And		  
his		
work		
is		
not		
confined		
to		
crime		 
.		 
Sheriff		 
Taylor		
is		
the		
kind		
of		
man		
who		
opens		
up		
for		
a		
drug		
store		
owner		
who		
is		
running		
late		
to		
work		
and		
helps		
an		
elderly		
woman		
deal		
with		
a		
new		
pharmacist		
who		
does		
not		
want		
to		
give		
her		
pills		
without		
a		
prescription		 
.		 
He		 
helps		
a		
talented		
local		
guitarist		
who		
is		
making		
a		
nuisance		
of		
himself		
find		
a		
job		
with		
a		
traveling		
musician		 
.		 
When		 
his		
housekeeper		
gets		
married		 
,		
Sheriff		
Taylor		
performs		
the		
rites		 
.		 
His		 
kindness		
and		
his		
sense		
of		
Mayberry		
matter		
far		
more		
than		
his		
capacity		
for		
violence		 
.		 
Not		  
only		
is		
this		
sort		
of		
work		
absent		
from		
contemporary		
pop		
culture		
about		
policing		 
,		
the		
idea		
that		
such		
service		
to		
the		
community		
is		
not		
quite		
real		
police		
work		
lingers		
under		
two		
of		
the		
funnier		
and		
more		
thoughtful		
recent		
movies		
to		
engage		
with		
the		
idea		
of		
the		
idea		
of		
an		
escalated		
war		
on		
crime		 
.

rather		
than

Instead		 
of		
disabusing		
their		
notions		 
,		
both		
films		
indulge		
these		
characters		
by		
providing		
threats		
that

,		
a		
newcomer		
to		
the		
small

Butterman		
grew		
up		 
,		
fails		
to		
confirm		
the		
idea		
of		
urban		
police		
work		
that		
Butterman		
has		
gleaned		
from		
American		
movies		
like

The

is		
that

tactics

A

a

out

local		
park		 
.		 
When		 
action		
arrives		 
,		
they		
lack		
the		
basic		
competence		
to		
respond		 
.		 
After		 
they		
arrest		
a		
drug		
dealer		 
,		
he		
has		
to		
be		
released		
because		
Schmidt

Jenko		
forget

read

man

But		 
their

redeems		
them

The

are		
the		
only		
people		
who		
are		
strapped		
up		
with		
enough		
weaponry		
to		
defeat		
them		 
.		 
These		  
are		
the		
movies		
that		
are		
actually		
engaging		
with		
the		
idea		
of		
police		
escalation		
rather		
than		
simply		
adopting		
such		
tactics		
in		
the		
name		
of		
exciting		
action		
sequences

"		   
The		
Fast

As

out

that

uptight		
FBI

needs

at

for		
the

to

themselves		
against

terrorist		
Bane

That		 
is		
actually		
rather		
generous		 
:		
most		
superhero		
movies		
involve		
threats		
so		
large		
that		
the

are		
irrelevant

The
