Missouri		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		
put		
the		
state		
highway		
patrol		
in		
charge		
of		
security		
here		
Thursday		
in		
hopes		
of		
quelling		
nightly		
clashes		
between		
protesters		
angry		
over		
a		
police		
shooting		
of		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		
and		
SWAT		
teams		
using		
tear		
gas		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Nixon		
tapped		
a		
highway		
patrol		
captain		
with		
ties		
to		
the		
local		
community		
to		
lead		
the		
effort		 
.		 
The		 
decision		
followed		
days		
of		
escalating		
tension		
between		
police		
and		
protesters		
that		
has		
been		
documented		
minute-by-minute		
on		
social		
media		
and		
cable-TV		
news		
channels		 
.		 
"		   
Lately		
it		
has		
looked		
a		
little		
more		
like		
a		
war		
zone		
--		
and		
that		
's		
unacceptable		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Nixon		
said		
of		
the		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		
of		
about		
21,000		
residents		 
.		 
The		  
shooting		
of		
18		 
-		
year-old		
Michael		
Brown		
Saturday		
led		
to		
peaceful		
protests		
as		
well		
as		
broken		
windows		 
,		
looting		
and		
burning		
of		
several		
buildings		 
.		 
Well-armed		 
police		
donned		
helmets		
and		
shields		 
,		
used		
armored		
vehicles		
and		
dispersed		
crowds		
with		
tear		
gas		 
.		 
Police		 
elsewhere		
have		
moved		
away		
from		
using		
aggressive		
tactics		
to		
control		
mass		
gatherings		 
,		
fearing		
they		
can		
be		
provocative		
and		
militaristic		 
.		 
President		  
Barack		
Obama		
on		
Thursday		
expressed		
concern		
over		
the		
"		 
violent		
turn		 
"		
of		
events		 
,		
saying		
there		
is		
no		
excuse		
for		
violence		
against		
police		 
,		
or		
for		
law		
enforcement		
to		
use		
excessive		
force		
against		
peaceful		
protesters		 
.		 
But		  
on		
Thursday		
night		 
,		
protests		
were		
peaceful		
and		
streets		
remained		
open		
to		
traffic		 
.		 
The		  
president		
called		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
death		
a		
heartbreaking		
loss		
while		
declining		
to		
draw		
conclusions		
amid		
an		
ongoing		
investigation		 
.		 
His		 
careful		
response		 
,		
made		
from		
his		
vacation		
on		
Martha		
's		
Vineyard		 
,		
Mass.		 
,		
underscored		
the		
challenges		
the		
first		
AfricanAmerican		
president		
has		
faced		
as		
he		
tries		
to		
calibrate		
how		
much		
and		
how		
often		
to		
use		
that		
distinction		
to		
weigh		
in		
on		
issues		
involving		
race		 
.		 
In		  
an		
unusual		
move		 
,		
the		
police		
tactics		
used		
earlier		
in		
the		
week		
also		
were		
called		
into		
question		
Thursday		
by		
the		
nation		
's		
top		
law-enforcement		
official		 
,		
Attorney		
General		
Eric		
Holder		 
,		
who		
said		
the		
nightly		
scenes		
of		
confrontations		
"		 
cannot		
continue		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
name		
of		
the		
officer		
who		
shot		
Mr.		
Brown		
could		
be		
released		
Friday		 
,		
according		
to		
St.		
Louis		
County		
Police		
Chief		
Jon		
Belmar		 
,		
though		
it		
is		
n't		
certain		 
.		 
Police		 
have		
so		
far		
refused		
to		
release		
the		
name		 
,		
saying		
such		
a		
step		
could		
endanger		
the		
officer		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Nixon		
faced		
growing		
pressure		
to		
take		
action		
as		
repeated		
calls		
for		
calm		
fell		
flat		
and		
racial		
unrest		
grew		
in		
a		
city		
where		
the		
population		
is		
two-thirds		
AfricanAmerican		
while		
the		
police		
force		
is		
largely		
white		 
.		 
The		 
governor		
promised		
a		
shift		
in		
tone		
under		
Highway		
Patrol		
Capt.		
Ronald		
S.		
Johnson		 
,		
an		
AfricanAmerican		
veteran		
of		
the		
force		 
,		
who		
currently		
commands		
about		
300		
troopers		 
.		 
Capt.		  
Johnson		
addressed		
protesters		
directly		
Thursday		
evening		 
,		
fielding		
questions		
and		
assuring		
them		
things		
would		
be		
different		 
.		 
"		  
I		
do		
n't		
expect		
to		
have		
what		
we		
had		
last		
night		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		 
.		 
"		   
When		
I		
see		
a		
young		
lady		
cry		
because		
of		
fear		
of		
this		
uniform		 
,		
we		
have		
a		
problem		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Johnson		
said		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Johnson		
approached		
a		
group		 
,		
many		
teenagers		
and		
20		 
-		
year-olds		 
,		
who		
appeared		
angry		
and		
were		
wearing		
bandannas		
over		
their		
faces		 
.		 
He		 
stood		
in		
the		
middle		
of		
the		
group		
and		
assured		
them		
"		 
there		
will		
be		
no		
tear		
gas		
tonight		 
.		 
"		 
Some		  
protesters		
were		
n't		
convinced		
the		
changes		
by		
Mr.		
Nixon		
would		
restore		
peace		
to		
the		
community		
and		
confidence		
in		
the		
police		 
.		 
"		  
It		
's		
not		
going		
to		
make		
a		
difference		 
,		 
"		
said		
26

year-old		
Anthony		
Ross		 
,		
who		
stood		
across		
from		
the		
police		
station		
as		
Mr.		
Nixon		
announced		
the		
change		 
.		 
Pierce		  
Holmes		
wanted		
to		
know		
why		
Mr.		
Nixon		
did		
n't		
make		
the		
announcement		
in		
Ferguson		
instead		
of		
at		
the		
University		
of		
Missouri		
St.		
Louis		 
.		 
The		 
29		 
-		
year-old		
protester		
said		
he		
is		
advocating		
nonviolence		
but		
has		
heard		
people		
talk		
about		
the		
potential		
for		
more		
violence		
in		
the		
days		
ahead

Police		  
had		
defended		
their		
approach		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
pointing		
to		
the		
few		
injuries		
suffered		
in		
recent		
days		 
,		
the		
dangerous		
situation		
they		
confronted		
and		
looting		
of		
several

on		
Monday		
night

"		   
My		
officers

acted		
with		
an		
incredible		
amount

restraint

I		
'm		
very		
proud

that

Before		  
Mr.

County		
Police		
spokesman		
Brian		
Schellman		
said		
criminals		
are		
mixing		
with

leading		
to		
the

"		   
When

said		
Kevin		
Ahlbrand		 
,		
president		
of		
the		
Missouri		
Fraternal		
Order		
of		
Police		 
.		 
Over		  
the		
past		
decade		 
,		
some		
police		
officials		
have		
come		
to		
view		
certain		
crowd-control		
tactics		
--		
such		
as		
firing		
tear		
gas		
and		
confronting		
protesters		
en		
masse		
--		
as		
outdated

John		 
Cutter

a		
former		
New

called		
tear

Seattle		
police		
official		
Paul

officers		
at		
the		
1999		
protests		
at		
a		
World		
Trade		
Organization		
meeting		
in		
that		
city		
deployed		
"		 
a		
large		
amount		
of		
chemical		
munitions		 
,		
sometimes		
ineffectively		 
.		 
"		 
Mr.		  
McDonagh		
also		
wrote		
that		
police		
now		
try		
to		
avoid		
using		
body		
armor		
and		
have		
more		
plainclothes		
officers		
moving		
within		
a		
crowd		
with		
the		
goal		
of		
isolating		
troublemakers		
from		
the		
larger		
group		
of		
peaceful		
protesters

The		  
clashes		
in		
Ferguson		
come		
amid		
a		
wider		
debate		
over		
what		
some		
critics		
see		
as		
the		
militarization		
of		
police		
departments		 
,		
fueled		
since		
2001		
by		
federal		
grants		
meant		
to		
beef		
up		
counterterrorism		
programs		
in		
U.S.		
cities

and		
a		
Pentagon		
program		
that		
sent		
military		
gear		
from		
the		
wars		
in		
Iraq

Afghanistan		
to		
local		
law
