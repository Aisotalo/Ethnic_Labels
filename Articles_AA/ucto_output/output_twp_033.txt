A		
St.		
Louis		
County		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
not		
to		
indict		
Darren		
Wilson		
illustrates		
the		
difficulty		
of		
bringing		
charges		
against		
police		
officers		 
,		
particularly		
when		
there		
are		
such		
widely		
divergent		
eyewitness		
accounts

officers		
tend		
to		
be		
given		
the

the

experts

The		  
grand		
jury		
voted		
to		
not		
bring		
charges		
against		
Wilson

the

officer		
who		
shot

18

year-old		
Michael		
Brown		
three		
months		
ago		
during		
an		
encounter		
on		
a		
Ferguson		
street		 
.		 
The		  
decision		
against		
bringing		
charges		
is		
notable		
because		
the		
legal		
threshold		
for		
a		
grand		
jury		
is		
lower		
than		
at		
a		
trial		 
.		 
The		 
grand		
jurors		
had		
to		
determine		
only		
that		
there		
was		
probable		
cause		
to		
believe		
Wilson		
committed		
a		
crime		
-		
not		
that		
there		
was		
proof		
beyond		
a		
reasonable		
doubt		 
.		 
The		  
vote		 
,		
legal		
experts		
say		 
,		
shows		
that		
enough		
jurors		
believed		
that		
Wilson		
probably		
acted		
in		
self-defense		
as		
he		
faced		
off		
with		
Brown		
or		
that		
Wilson		
was		
within		
his		
rights		
as		
a		
police		
officer		
to		
use		
deadly		
force		 
.		 
"		   
If		
an		
officer		
thinks		
someone		
is		
a		
deadly		
threat		 
,		
they		
are		
not		
allowed		
to		
fire		
warning		
shots

no

The		  
U.S.		
Supreme		
Court		
has		
repeatedly		
ruled		
in

of

which		
could		
have		
made		
it		
difficult		
to		
successfully		
prosecute		
Wilson		 
.		 
The		 
court		
has		
repeatedly		
said		
that		
use		
of		
deadly		
force		
is		
justified		
if		
officers		
think		
they		
must		
act		
to		
protect		
the		
lives
