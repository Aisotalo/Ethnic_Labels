Tensions		
flared		
Monday		
night		
as		
a		
large		
contingent		
of		
police		
confronted		
demonstrators		
here		
after		
hours		
of		
peaceful		
marching		
to		
protest		
the		
shooting		
death		
of		
an		
unarmed		
teenager		
by		
an		
officer		 
.		 
Hundreds		  
flocked		
here		
early		
in		
the		
evening		
without		
major		
incident		 
,		
marking		
a		
sharp		
contrast		
to		
the		
violent		
clashes		
the		
night		
before		 
.		 
But		 
shortly		
after		
9:30	TIME	 
,		
a		
group		
of		
protesters		
were		
seen		
throwing		
projectiles		
toward		
police		
in		
the		
street		 
,		
which		
prompted		
a		
swift		
blockade		 
.		 
Officers		  
in		
body		
armor		
and		
gas		
masks		
moved		
into		
the		
crowd		
to		
extract		
some		
of		
the		
protesters		
under		
the		
glare		
of		
dozens		
of		
television		
cameras		 
.		 
At		 
10:20	TIME

,		 
protest		
leaders		
led		
a		
smattering		
of		
applause		
as		
a		
small		
group		
of		
aggressive		
demonstrators		
pulled		
back		
and		
police		
stood		
their		
ground		 
.		 
The		  
Missouri		
National		
Guard		 
,		
who		
arrived		
in		
this		
city		
riven		
for		
more		
than		
a		
week		
by		
unrest		 
,		
did		
n't		
appear		
to		
be		
involved		
in		
the		
confrontation		
at		
West		
Florissant		
and		
Ferguson		
avenues		
--		
the		
site		
of		
other		
standoffs		
during		
the		
last		
nine		
days		
and		
within		
a		
few		
miles		
of		
where		
18		 
-		
year-old		
Michael		
Brown		
died		 
.		 
The		  
challenge		
to		
officers		
came		
from		
"		 
provocateurs		
trying		
to		
provoke		
police		 
,		 
"		
said		
Malik		
Shabazz		
of		
Black		
Lawyers		
for		
Justice		
and		
a		
protest		
leader		 
.		 
"		  
Every		
night		
I		
see		
them		
trying		
to		
provoke		
this		
situation		 
.		 
But		 
tonight		
it		
's		
not		
going		
down		 
.		 
"		 
At		  
one		
point		 
,		
demonstrators		
formed		
a		
human		
chain		
to		
prevent		
more		
aggressive		
protesters		
from		
reaching		
the		
police		
line		 
.		 
Authorities		 
used		
sirens		
and		
warned		
marchers		
to		
clear		
the		
road		
or		
risk		
arrest		 
.		 
Earlier		  
Monday		 
,		
President		
Barack		
Obama		
said		
Attorney		
General		
Eric		
Holder		
would		
travel		
to		
Ferguson		
on		
Wednesday		
and		
called		
on		
members		
of		
the		
community		
to		
seek		
understanding		
rather		
than		
"		 
holler		 
"		
at		
each		
other		 
.		 
"		   
While		
I		
understand		
the		
passions		
and		
the		
anger		
that		
arise		
over		
the		
death		
of		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
giving		
into		
that		
anger		
by		
looting		
or		
carrying		
guns		 
,		
and		
even		
attacking		
the		
police		 
,		
only		
serves		
to		
raise		
tensions		
and		
stir		
chaos		 
,		 
"		
the		
president		
said		 
.		 
"		  
It		
undermines		
rather		
than		
advances		
justice

St.		  
Louis		
County		
police		 
,		
who		
are		
leading		
the		
investigation		 
,		
said		
Officer		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
28		
years		
old		 
,		
was		
pushed		
into		
his		
car		
and		
a		
struggle		
over		
his		
gun		
ensued		 
.		 
Outside		 
the		
car		 
,		
the		
police		
said		 
,		
he		
shot		
Mr.		
Brown		
several		
times		 
.		 
He		 
died		
about		
35		
feet		
from		
the		
vehicle		 
.		 
The		  
Brown		
family		
has		
disputed		
that		
account		
and		
released		
a		
private		
autopsy		
report		
showing		
he		
had		
been		
shot		
six		
times		 
,		
including		
twice		
in		
the		
head		 
.		 
A		 
family		
attorney		
said		
the		
finding		
corroborated		
their		
belief		
that		
the		
teen		
had		
been		
shot		
while		
surrendering

Separately

an		
official

familiar		
with		
the		
probe

Even		  
as		
the		
well-equipped		
National		
Guard		
troops		
arrived		 
,		
Missouri		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		
said		
they		
would		
play		
only		
a		
limited		
role		
in		
protecting		
the		
police		
command		
center		
that		
officials		
said		
had		
come		
under		
attack		
by		
protesters		
Sunday		
night		 
.		 
The		 
governor		
also		
lifted		
a		
two-night		
curfew		
in		
hopes		
of		
avoiding		
another		
clash		 
.		 
On		  
Friday		 
,		
Ferguson		
police		
released		
video		
footage		
purportedly		
showing		
Mr.		
Brown		
involved		
in		
a		
strong-arm		
robbery		
at		
a		
convenience		
store		
minutes		
before		
his		
encounter		
with		
Officer		
Wilson		 
.		 
In		 
a		
statement		
Monday		 
,		
Mr.		
Holder		
faulted		
local		
officials		
for		
"		 
selective		
release		 
"		 
"		
of		
information		
about		
the		
dead		
man		 
.		 
The		  
curfew		
in		
the		
city		
of

a.m.		
on		
Sunday		
and		
Monday		
after		
looting		
and		
other		
vandalism

night		 
.		 
But		 
violent		
clashes		
erupted		
between		
protesters		
and		
police		
in		
the		
hours		
before		
the		
curfew		
took		
effect		
those		
nights		 
.		 
By		  
midafternoon		
Monday		 
,		
the		
scene		
along		
the		
city		
's		
main		
road		
remained		
calm		
as		
temperatures		
neared		
90		
degrees		 
.		 
A		 
few		
hundred		
protesters		
held		
signs		
while		
National		
Guard

said		
that		
"		 
as		
long		
as		
there		
are		
vandals		
and		
looters		
and		
threats		
to		
the		
people		
and		
property		
of		
Ferguson		 
,		
we		
must		
take		
action		
to		
protect		
our		
citizens

"		 
The		  
National		
Guard		
has		
been		
called		
upon		
to		
keep		
the		
peace		
several		
times		
in
