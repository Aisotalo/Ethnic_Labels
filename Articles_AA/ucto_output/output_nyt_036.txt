As		  
protests		
take		
a		
turn

Holder		
finds		
it		
harder		
to		
ease		
racial		
tensions

WASHINGTON		  
--		
Watching		
television		
from		
home		
as		
vandals		
smashed		
windows		 
,		
set		
fires		
and		
looted		 
,		
Attorney		
General		
Eric		
H.		
Holder		
Jr.		 
,		
saw		
that		
the		
streets		
of		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
,		
had		
changed		
since		
this		
summer		
when		
he		
helped		
soothe		
tensions		
there		
after		
the		
fatal		
shooting		
of		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		
by		
a		
white		
police		
officer		 
.		 
The		  
protests		
had		
begun		
in		
August		
as		
racially		
charged		
but		
mostly		
peaceful		
demonstrations		 
,		
and		
Mr.		
Holder		 
,		
the		
nation		
's		
first		
AfricanAmerican		
attorney		
general		 
,		
was		
comfortable		
in		
his		
role		
as		
peacemaker		 
.		 
He		 
spoke		
of		
his		
experiences		
as		
a		
victim		
of		
racial		
profiling		
and		
called		
for		
greater		
understanding		
between		
minority		
neighborhoods		
and		
the		
police		 
.		 
On		  
Tuesday		
morning		 
,		
hours		
after		
a		
county		
prosecutor		
in		
Missouri		
announced		
that		
no		
charges		
would		
be		
filed		
in		
the		
shooting		
death		
of		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
18		 
,		
Mr.		
Holder		
told		
aides		
that		
the		
situation		
had		
clearly		
taken		
a		
turn		
for		
the		
worse		 
.		 
"		  
There		
is		
a		
difference		
between		
a		
demonstration		
and		
a		
riot		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Holder		
said		
in		
a		
meeting		 
,		
aides		
said		 
.		 
Ferguson		  
has		
become		
a		
personal		
issue		
for		
Mr.		
Holder		 
,		
who		
announced		
his		
resignation		
in		
September		
and		
is		
staying		
on		
until		
the		
nominee		
to		
succeed		
him		 
,		
Loretta		
E.		
Lynch		 
,		
is		
confirmed		
by		
the		
Senate		 
.		 
He		 
was		
struck		
during		
his		
trip		
there		
by		
the		
stories		
of		
the		
police		
abusing		
suspects		 
,		
disproportionately		
stopping		
black		
residents		
and		
using		
tickets		
in		
black		
neighborhoods		
as		
a		
way		
to		
raise		
money		 
.		 
But		 
Mr.		
Holder		
now		
finds		
himself		
with		
limited		
options		
to		
ease		
the		
city		
's		
racial		
tensions		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Holder		
is		
the		
administration		
's		
most		
outspoken		
voice		
on		
race		
and		
civil		
rights		 
,		
but		
some		
officials		
believe		
that		
role		
became		
less		
relevant		
as		
Ferguson		
's		
unrest		
turned		
destructive		 
.		 
White		 
House		
officials		 
,		
however		 
,		
said		
it		
was		
important		
for		
Mr.		
Holder		
to		
reiterate		
that		
relations		
between		
the		
police		
and		
minorities		
must		
improve		
around		
the		
country		 
.		 
In		  
a		
hastily		
called		
news		
conference		
late		
Tuesday		
afternoon		 
,		
Mr.		
Holder		
announced		
plans		
to		
visit		
cities		
around		
the		
country		
to		
talk		
about		
race		
relations		
and		
policing		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Holder		
also		
called		
on		
peaceful		
demonstrators		
to		
"		 
isolate		 
"		
and		
denounce		
those		
who		
had		
brought		
violence		
and		
disorder		
to		
Ferguson		 
.		 
"		   
The		
way		
in		
which		
we		
make		
progress		
in		
this		
country		
is		
when		
we		
have		
seen		
peaceful		 
,		
nonviolent		
protests		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Holder		
said		 
.		 
Those		 
protesters		
who		
prevented		
violence		 
,		
he		
said		 
,		
were		
heroes		 
.		 
But		  
there		
was		
no		
indication		
that		
he		
planned		
to		
make		
another		
trip		
to		
Ferguson		 
,		
where		
the		
police		
faced		
small		
roving		
groups		
of		
looters		
and		
vandals		 
,		
not		
the		
large		
organized		
protests		
of		
three		
months		
ago		 
.		 
A		  
product		
of		
the		
civil		
rights		
era		 
,		
Mr.		
Holder		 
,		
63		 
,		
grew		
up		
with		
images		
of		
violent		
clashes		
between		
protesters		
and		
the		
police		 
,		
when		
"		 
millions		
of		
people		
braved		
dogs		
and		
fire		
hoses		 
,		
billy		
clubs		
and		
baseball		
bats		 
,		
bullets		
and		
bombs		 
,		
in		
order		
to		
secure		
the		
rights		
which		
were		
theirs		
as		
Americans		 
,		 
"		
he		
said		
earlier		
this		
year		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Holder		
opened		
a		
broad		
civil		
rights		
investigation		
in		
the		
Ferguson		
Police		
Department		
this		
summer		 
,		
which		
he		
recently		
said		
offered		
the		
possibility		
for		
"		 
wholesale		
change		 
.		  
"		 
But		
that		
investigation		
is		
months		
from		
completion		 
,		
too		
distant		
to		
offer		
immediate		
reassurance		
to		
people		
angry		
that		
the		
police		
officer		 
,		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
will		
not		
be		
prosecuted		 
.		 
The		 
Justice		
Department		
's		
more		
narrow		
investigation		
into		
the		
shooting		
itself		
is		
winding		
down		 
,		
but		
officials		
have		
said		
the		
evidence		
so		
far		
does		
not		
support		
federal		
civil		
rights		
charges		
against		
Officer		
Wilson		 
.		 
Despite		  
the		
looting		
and		
fires		 
,		
federal		
officials		
in		
Missouri		
told		
Mr.		
Holder		
that		
violence		
and		
mischief		
Monday		
night		
were		
limited		
and		
reported		
no		
widespread		
criticism		
of		
the		
local		
police		
response		
to		
lawful		
protesters		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Holder		
was		
upset		 
,		
however		 
,		
at		
the		
way		
the		
St.		
Louis		
County		
prosecutor		 
,		
Robert		
P.		
McCulloch		 
,		
made		
his		
announcement		 
,		
aides		
said		 
.		 
Justice		  
Department		
officials		
had		
hoped		
that		
Mr.		
McCulloch		
--		
a		
controversial		
figure		
among		
many		
protesters		
--		
would		
simply		
issue		
a		
statement		
explaining		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		 
,		
rather		
than		
hold		
a		
televised		
news		
conference		
that		
would		
put		
the		
focus		
squarely		
on		
him		 
.		 
In		 
calls		
with		
federal		
officials		
Tuesday		 
,		
Mr.		
Holder		
was		
bewildered		 
,		
aides		
said		 
,		
that		
Mr.		
McCulloch		
had		
announced		
his		
decision		
late		
at		
night		 
,		
a		
time		
when		
clashes		
between		
demonstrators		
and		
police		
have		
been		
at		
their		
worst		 
.		 
Several		  
federal		
officials		
said		
they		
also		
were		
frustrated		
by		
Mr.		
McCulloch		 
,		
who		
criticized		
journalists		
and		
recounted		
the		
evidence		
without		
ever		
mentioning		
that		
Mr.		
Brown		
had		
been		
unarmed		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Holder		
was		
particularly		
angry		 
,		
Justice		
Department		
officials		
said		 
,		
that		
Mr.		
McCulloch		
invoked		
his		
name		
when		
announcing		
the		
local		
investigation		
's		
findings		 
.		 
"		  
As		
promised		
by		
me		
and		
Attorney		
General		
Holder		 
,		
there		
was		
a		
full		
investigation		
and		
presentation		
of		
all		
evidence		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
McCulloch		
said		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Holder		
had		
worked		
for		
months		
to		
establish		
the		
Justice		
Department		
as		
a		
credible		 
,		
independent		
investigator		 
.		 
He		 
refused		
repeated		
entreaties		
to		
join		
local		
officials		
in		
Ferguson		 
.		 
They		 
had		
hoped		
that		
if		
Mr.		
Holder		
simultaneously		
announced		
his		
findings		 
,		
it		
would		
reassure		
the		
AfricanAmerican		
community		
and		
help		
prevent		
unrest		 
.		 
"		   
Though		
we		
have		
shared		
information		
with		
local		
prosecutors		
during		
the		
course		
of		
our		
investigation		 
,		
the		
federal		
inquiry		
has		
been		
independent		
of		
the		
local		
one		
from		
the		
start		 
,		
and		
remains		
so		
now		 
,		 
"		
the		
Justice		
Department		
said		
on		
Monday		 
.		 
"		  
Even		
at		
this		
mature		
stage		
of		
the		
investigation		 
,		
we		
have		
avoided		
prejudging		
any		
of		
the		
evidence		 
.		 
"
