FERGUSON

Mo.		
--		
"		 
Hands		
up		 
,		
do		
n't		
shoot		 
!		  
"		 
has		
become		
the		
rallying		
cry		
for		
protesters		
and		
their		
supporters		
in		
this		
predominantly		
black		
city		 
,		
where		
an		
unarmed		
18		 
-		
year-old		
was		
shot		
and		
killed		
by		
a		
police		
officer		
over		
the		
weekend		 
.		 
The		  
shooting		
triggered		
both		
peaceful		
vigils		
and		
violent		
looting		 
.		 
It		 
also		
brought		
nearly		
nonstop		
protests		
led		
mainly		
by		
young		
black		
men		
and		
women		
upset		
by		
media		
reports		
from		
purported		
witnesses		
that		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
the		
teen		
killed		
by		
police		 
,		
had		
his		
hands		
up		
and		
was		
surrendering		
to		
police		
when		
he		
was		
shot		 
.		 
Many		  
of		
these		
protesters		
raised		
their		
hands		
and		
adopted		
the		
rallying		
cry		
when		
approached		
by		
police		 
.		 
"		  
The		
reason		
for		
the		
two		
hands		
up		
is		
he		
had		
nothing		
on		
him		 
,		 
"		
said		
Chris		
Turner		 
,		
27		 
,		
who		
stood		
on		
the		
edge		
of		
a		
protest		
Monday		
afternoon		 
.		 
Police		  
declined		
to		
say		
whether		
Mr.		
Brown		
had		
his		
hands		
up		
when		
he		
was		
shot		 
,		
citing		
the		
ongoing		
investigation		 
.		 
But		 
they		
described		
a		
violent		
confrontation		
between		
Mr.		
Brown		
and		
the		
police		
officer		
just		
before		
the		
shooting		 
,		
including		
a		
struggle		
for		
his		
gun		
inside		
his		
police		
car		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Brown		
was		
then		
shot		
multiple		
times		
outside		
the		
car		 
,		
and		
he		
died		
about		
35		
feet		
away		 
.		 
"		   
I		
understand		
the		
public		
has		
a		
right		
to		
be		
skeptical		 
,		
and		
I		
appreciate		
that		 
,		 
"		
said		
St.		
Louis		
County		
Police		
Chief		
Jon		
Belmar		
in		
a		
news		
conference		
Monday		 
.		 
"		  
But		
I		
would		
also		
ask		
the		
public		
to		
be		
reasonable		
because		
it		
takes		
a		
long		
time		
to		
make		
sure		
we		
do		
this		
investigation		
the		
right		
way		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
"		 
hands		
up		 
"		
gesture		
could		
be		
seen		
across		
town		 
,		
and		
local		
youths		
worked		
to		
leverage		
social		
media		 
,		
designing		
hashtags		
such		
as		
#		 
handsupdontshoot		 
.		 
"		   
It		
's		
on		
Facebook		
and		
Instagram		 
,		 
"		
said		
20		 
-		
year-old		
Delvan		
Perryman		 
.		 
"		  
They		
do		
n't		
want		
it		
to		
be		
just		
St.		
Louis		 
;		
they		
think		
it		
should		
be		
nationwide		 
.
