After		  
Ferguson		 
,		
how		
should		
police		
respond		
to		
protests		 
?		 
The		  
events		
these		
last		
few		
days		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Missouri		 
,		
ought		
to		
be		
of		
grave		
concern		
to		
anyone		
who		
believes		
in		
the		
First		
Amendment		 
,		
and		
specifically		
the		
rights		
to		
free		
speech		 
,		
protest		
and		
assembly		 
.		 
Police		 
arrested		
a		
St.		
Louis		
alderman		
and		
two		
reporters		 
,		
and		
tear-gassed		
a		
news		
crew		
from		
Al-Jazeera		 
.		 
There		 
were		
also		
reports		 
,		
video		
and		
images		
of		
police		
tear-gassing		
and		
intimidating		
peaceful		
protests		
all		
over		
the		
town		 
.		 
While		  
it		
's		
true		
there		
were		
rioting		 
,		
looting		
and		
violence		
directed		
at		
police		 
,		
the		
initial		
protests		
over		
the		
killing		
of		
unarmed		
teenager		
Michael		
Brown		
were		
peaceful		 
.		 
The		 
problem		
lies		
in		
the		
local		
police		
response		
to		
those		
protests		 
:		
They		
brought		
out		
the		
full		
riot		
arsenal		 
.		 
Here		  
we		
have		
a		
community		
that		
does		
n't		
see		
itself		
reflected		
in		
the		
police		
force		 
.		 
Ferguson		 
is		
67		
percent		
black		 
,		
while		
its		
police		
force		
is		
more		
than		
90		
percent		
white		 
.		 
It		 
's		
a		
community		
with		
long-simmering		
racial		
tension		
between		
police		
and		
the		
people		
they		
serve		 
.		 
It		 
has		
now		
been		
well-reported		
that		
blacks		
are		
significantly		
over-represented		
when		
it		
comes		
to		
stop-and-frisks		 
,		
traffic		
stops		
and		
arrests		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
even		
though		
the		
town		
's		
white		
residents		
are		
more		
likely		
to		
be		
caught		
with		
contraband		
like		
drugs		
or		
illegal		
weapons		 
.		 
It		 
is		
n't		
difficult		
to		
see		
why		
black		
residents		
of		
Ferguson		
may		
have		
already		
felt		
as		
if		
the		
police		
are		
an		
outside		
force		
that		
has		
been		
imposed		
upon		
them		 
,		
rather		
than		
a		
group		
of		
public		
servants		
selected		
from		
the		
community		
to		
protect		
them		
from		
harm		 
.		 
We		  
then		
have		
an		
incident		
that		
represents		
all		
of		
these		
problems		
in		
a		
concentrated		
form		
-		
an		
unarmed		
black		
man		
was		
killed		
by		
a		
(		 
reportedly		 
)		
white		
police		
officer		
who		
had		
stopped		
him		
as		
he		
was		
walking		
home		 
.		 
The		 
police		 
,		
under		
pressure		 
,		
released		
the		
officer		
's		
name		
Friday		 
,		
along		
with		
an		
incident		
report		
that		
raised		
many		
questions		 
.		 
But		 
they		
have		
not		
released		
Brown		
's		
autopsy		
report		 
.		 
All		 
of		
this		
only		
adds		
to		
perception		
of		
a		
Ferguson		
Police		
Department		
that		
is		
detached		 
,		
unaccountable		 
,		
opaque		
and		
unconcerned		
with		
how		
it		
is		
perceived		
by		
the		
community		
it		
serves		 
.		 
If		 
a		
town		
's		
citizens		
are		
reminded		
over		
and		
over		
again		
that		
the		
law		
has		
no		
respect		
for		
them		 
,		
we		
should		
n't		
be		
surprised		
if		
they		
begin		
to		
lose		
respect		
for		
the		
law		 
.		 
This		 
is		
n't		
an		
excuse		
for		
the		
looting		
and		
rioting		 
.		 
But		 
it		
does		
add		
context		 
.		 
How		  
should		
police		
respond		
to		
protest		 
?		 
And		 
how		
should		
they		
respond		
when		
protests		
turn		
violent		 
?		 
One		  
of		
the		
pioneers		
of		
community		
policing		
-		
a		
form		
of		
policing		
that		
stresses		
interaction		
over		
reaction		 
,		
de-escalation		
over		
brute		
force		 
,		
and		
that		
police		
should		
have		
a		
stake		
in		
the		
communities		
they		
serve		
_		 
is		
Jerry		
Wilson		 
,		
appointed		
police		
chief		
for		
the		
District		
of		
Columbia		
in		
1969		 
.		 
That		 
was		
a		
turbulent		
time		
in		
America		 
,		
and		
Wilson		
took		
office		
just		
after		
the		
riots		
following		
the		
assassination		
of		
Martin		
Luther		
King		
Jr.		
had		
ripped		
Washington		
apart		 
.		 
But		 
he		
recruited		
police		
officers		
from		
the		
city		
's		
residents		
and		
tried		
to		
make		
the		
police		
force		
more		
reflective		
of		
the		
city		 
.		 
He		 
also		
took		
a		
much		
different		
approach		
to		
protest		 
.		 
In		 
an		
interview		
for		
my		
recent		
book		
on		
police		
militarization		 
,		
Wilson		
elaborated		
on		
his		
approach		
to		
protest		 
.		 
He		 
said		
he		
believed		
an		
intimidating		
police		
presence		
"		 
did		
n't		
prevent		
confrontation		 
,		
it		
invited		
it		 
.		  
"		 
He		
put		
his		
riot		
control		
teams		
in		
buses		 
,		
then		
parked		
the		
buses		
close		
by		 
,		
but		
out		
of		
sight		
of		
protesters		 
.		 
Instead		 
of		
brute		
force		
and		
reactionary		
policing		
that		
tended		
to		
pit		
cops		
against		
citizens		 
,		
Wilson		
"		 
believed		
that		
cops		
were		
more		
effective		
when		
they		
were		
welcomed		
and		
respected		
in		
the		
neighborhoods		
they		
patrolled		 
.		 
"		 
It		  
's		
worth		
noting		
that		
during		
Wilson		
's		
tenure		 
,		
not		
only		
did		
Washington		
not		
see		
the		
level		
of		
rioting		
and		
protest		
violence		
we		
saw		
in		
other		
parts		
of		
the		
country		 
,		
crime		
fell		
in		
the		
city		 
,		
even		
as		
it		
soared		
across		
the		
rest		
of		
the		
country		 
.		 
The		  
1999		
WTO		
protests		
in		
Seattle		
represent		
another		
landmark		
moment		
in		
how		
police		
handle		
protest		
in		
America		 
.		 
Those		 
protests		
also		
began		
peacefully		 
,		
but		
eventually		
evolved		
into		
rioting		 
,		
mostly		
after		
police		
responded		
to		
peaceful		
protesters		
with		
tear		
gas		 
.		 
Reports		 
after		
the		
protests		
conducted		
by		
the		
city		
of		
Seattle		
and		
state		
of		
Washington		
found		
that		
police		
overreaction		 
,		
paranoia		
and		
misinformation		
played		
a		
major		
role		
in		
escalating		
the		
situation		 
.		 
Seattle		 
's		
chief		
of		
police		
at		
the		
time		 
,		
Norm		
Stamper		 
,		
now		
says		
his		
response		
to		
those		
protests		
was		
the		
biggest		
mistake		
of		
his		
career		 
.		 
I		 
also		
interviewed		
Stamper		
at		
length		
for		
my		
book		 
.		 
Here		 
's		
an		
excerpt		 
:		 
(		   
begin		
excerpt

There		  
were		
few		
injuries		
and		
no		
fatalities		 
,		
[		 
but		 
]		
the		
images		
that		
emerged		
from		
Seattle		
depicted		
a		
city		
that		
had		
lost		
control		 
.		 
Going		 
forward		
"		 
control		 
"		
would		
be		
the		
operative		
word		
in		
how		
police		
handled		
protests		 
.		 
In		 
the		
years		
to		
come		 
,		
the		
"		 
Darth		
Vader		 
"		
look		
would		
become		
the		
standard		
police		
presence		
at		
large		
protests		 
.		
.		
.		
.		 
There		 
would		
violent		 
,		
preemptive		
SWAT		
raids		 
,		
mass		
arrests		 
,		
and		
sweeping		
use		
of		
policed		
powers		
that		
would		
ensnare		
violent		
protesters		 
,		
peaceful		
protesters		 
,		
and		
people		
who		
had		
nothing		
to		
do		
with		
protest		
at		
all		 
.		 
Stamper		  
calls		
his		
decisions		
in		
Seattle		
"		 
the		
worst		
mistake		 
"		
of		
his		
career		
because		
he		
's		
seen		
how		
the		
police		
response		
to		
protest		
has		
changed		
since		
1999		 
.		 
"		  
We		
gassed		
fellow		
Americans		
engaging		
in		
civil		
disobedience		 
,		 
"		
Stamper		
says		 
.		 
"		  
We		
set		
a		
number		
of		
precedents		 
,		
most		
of		
them		
bad		 
.		 
And		 
police		
departments		
across		
the		
country		
learned		
all		
the		
wrong		
lessons		
from		
us		 
.		 
That		 
's		
disheartening		 
.		 
So		 
disheartening		 
.		 
I		 
mean		 
,		
you		
look		
at		
what		
happened		
to		
those		
Occupy		
protesters		
at		
U.C.		
Davis		 
,		
where		
the		
cop		
just		
sprays		
them		
down		
like		
he		
's		
watering		
a		
bed		
of		
flowers		 
,		
and		
I		
think		
that		
we		
played		
a		
part		
in		
making		
that		
sort		
of		
thing		
so		
common		
-		
so		
easy		
to		
do		
now		 
.		 
It		 
's		
beyond		
cringe-worthy		 
.		 
"		 
(

The		  
Occupy		
protests		
were		
also		
a		
fascinating		
case		
study		
in		
protest		
and		
how		
governments		
should		
respond		
to		
them		 
.		 
Because		 
the		
protests		
went		
on		
all		
over		
the		
country		 
,		
and		
because		
the		
police		
responses		
were		
so		
varied		
from		
city		
to		
city		 
,		
we		
can		
look		
at		
the		
different		
approaches		 
,		
the		
results		
those		
approaches		
produced		 
,		
and		
perhaps		
gain		
some		
insight		
into		
how		
to		
best		
protect		
safety		
and		
property		
without		
infringing		
on		
the		
civil		
rights		
and		
liberties		
of		
protesters		 
.		 
Lt.		  
Max		
Geron		
is		
in		
charge		
of		
the		
media		
relations		
and		
community		
affairs		
units		
of		
the		
Dallas		
Police		
Department		 
.		 
He		 
's		
also		
a		
security		
studies		
scholar		
who		
recently		
wrote		
his		
master		
's		
thesis		
on		
policing		
and		
protests		
at		
the		
Naval		
Postgraduate		
School		 
.		 
His		 
thesis		
studied		
police		
reactions		
to		
the		
Occupy		
protests		
in		
Oakland		 
,		
New		
York		 
,		
Portland		
and		
Dallas		 
.		 
"		   
The		
ideal		
police		
response		
to		
a		
protest		
is		
no		
response		
at		
all		 
,		 
"		
Geron		
says		 
.		 
(		  
Geron		
emphasized		
that		
he		
was		
speaking		
as		
a		
scholar		 
,		
and		
his		
views		
are		
his		
own		 
.		 
)		
"		 
You		
want		
to		
let		
people		
exercise		
their		
constitutional		
rights		
without		
interference		 
.		 
"		 
Barring		  
that		 
,		
Geron		
says		 
,		
it		
's		
important		
for		
police		
to		
communicate		
with		
protesters		
to		
establish		
expectations		 
.		 
"		  
The		
technical		
term		
is		
negotiated		
management

that

n't

allowed

"		 
But		  
Geron		
cautions		
against		
setting		
arbitrary		
expectations		 
,		
such		
as		
mandatory		
dispersal		
times		 
.		 
"		  
Most		
protesters		
will		
meet		 
,		
protest		
and		
go		
home		
when		
they		
feel		
they		
've		
made		
their		
point		 
.		 
If		 
they		
are		
n't		
breaking		
any		
laws		 
,		
they		
can		
be		
left		
to		
express		
themselves		 
.		  
"		 
Establishing		
a		
dispersal		
time		
then		
gives		
protesters		
something		
to		
rebel		
against		 
.		 
"		  
When		
you		
establish		
arbitrary		
rules		
that		
have		
no		
basis		
in		
law		 
,		
the		
police		
then		
feel		
they		
have		
to		
enforce		
those		
rules		
or		
they		
look		
illegitimate		 
.		 
"		 
Geron		  
also		
stresses		
fluidity		
and		
the		
ability		
to		
adjust		
on		
the		
fly		 
.		 
Police		 
organizations		
are		
fond		
of		
protocol		
and		
standard		
operating		
procedures		 
.		 
But		 
protests		
can		
be		
unpredictable		 
.		 
"		  
The		
standard		
or		
by		
the		
book		
response		
may		
not		
be		
the		
best		
response		 
,		 
"		
he		
says		 
.		 
He		 
points		
specifically		
to		
the		
Ferguson		
Police		
Department		
's		
delay		
in		
releasing		
the		
name		
of		
the		
police		
officer		
who		
shot		
Brown		 
.		 
"		  
That		
may		
be		
the		
policy		
there		 
.		 
But		 
you		
have		
to		
look		
at		
the		
situation		 
.		 
You		 
have		
a		
community		
that		
is		
upset		 
,		
that		
feels		
wronged		 
.		 
It		 
's		
important		
to		
establish		
trust		
with		
them		 
.		 
A		 
big		
part		
of		
that		
is		
helping		
them		
to		
believe		
that		
you		
're		
being		
straight		
and		
transparent		
with		
them		 
.		 
You		 
have		
to		
be		
sure		
to		
protect		
the		
officer

safety

but		
to		
win		
trust		
you		
have		
to		
be		
aware		
of		
the		
people		
's		
fears		 
,		
and		
you		
need		
to		
show		
you		
're		
willing

make		
concessions

accommodate		
those		
fears

"		 
One		  
active		
police		
chief		
who		
has		
adopted		
a		
less		
reactionary		
approach		
was		
Chris		
Burbank		
in		
Salt		
Lake		
City		 
.		 
I		 
profiled		
Burbank		
last		
fall		
for		
the		
Huffington		
Post		 
.		 
When		 
the		
Salt		
Lake		
city		
council		
told		
Burbank		
he		
'd		
have		
to		
remove		
the		
Occupy		
protesters		
from		
the		
park		
where		
they		
had		
been		
encamped		 
,		
he		
showed		
up		
at		
the		
camp		
and		
talked		
to		
the		
protesters		 
.		 
He		 
explained		
that		
they		
'd		
need		
to		
start		
leaving		
the		
park		
at		
night		
but		
that		
they		
could		
return		
during		
the		
day		 
.		 
They		 
could		
leave		
peacefully		
or		
could		
choose		
to		
be		
arrested		 
,		
and		
he		
had		
no		
problem		
if		
TV		
and		
newspaper		
cameras		
recorded		
them		
"		 
giving		
themselves		
up		
for		
their		
cause		 
.		 
"		 
When		  
eviction		
time		
came		
at		
Pioneer		
Park		 
,		
police		
wore		
their		
standard		
uniforms		 
.		 
Burbank		 
was		
first		
on		
the		
scene		 
,		
"		 
so		
that		
the		
first		
person		
the		
protesters		
saw		
was		
the		
one		
with		
whom		
they		
had		
already		
had		
a		
conversation		 
.		  
"		 
Most		
of		
the		
200		
protesters		
left		
voluntarily		 
;		
19		
were		
arrested		 
.		 
There		 
was		
no		
violence		 
,		
no		
rioting		
and		
little		
anger		 
.		 
"		   
I		
just		
do		
n't		
like		
the		
riot		
gear		 
,		 
"		
Burbank		
said		 
.		 
"		  
Some		
say		
not		
using		
it		
exposes		
my		
officers		
to		
a		
little		
bit		
more		
risk		 
.		 
That		 
could		
be		 
,		
but		
risk		
is		
part		
of		
the		
job		 
.		 
I		 
'm		
just		
convinced		
that		
when		
we		
don		
riot		
gear		 
,		
it		
says		
'		 
throw		
rocks		
and		
bottles		
at		
us		 
.		  
'		 
It		
invites		
confrontation		 
.		 
Two-way		 
communication		
and		
cooperation		
are		
what		
's		
important		 
.		 
"		 
Burbank		  
also		
dismisses		
the		
idea		
that		
his		
approach		
could		
only		
work		
in		
a		
smaller		
city		
like		
Salt		
Lake		 
.		 
"		  
I		
think		
it		
should		
be		
applied		
everywhere		 
.		 
That		 
's		
exactly		
how		
we		
as		
a		
nation		
should		
approach		
these		
events		 
.		 
We		 
should

's		
approach		
is		
far		
from		
common		 
,		
but		
there		
are		
at		
least		
some		
other		
police		
officials		
who		
share		
his		
philosophy		 
.		 
One		 
of		
them		
is		
former		
Madison

Police		
Chief		
David		
Couper		 
,		
who		
wrote		 
:		
"		 
Early		
in		
my		
police		
career		 
,		
I		
began		
to		
re-think		
the		
role		
of		
police		
and		
protest		
after		
I		
had		
witnessed		
and		
participated		
in		
too		
many		
that		
had		
gone		
wrong		 
.		 
I		 
was		
beginning		
to		
see		
that		
proximity		
mattered		 
,		
being		
close		
was		
safe-just		
like		
on		
the		
beat		 
.		 
Get		 
close		 
,		
talk		 
,		
stay		
in		
contact		 
.		 
The		 
further		
the		
police		
positioned		
themselves		
from		
people		
in		
the		
crowd		 
,		
the		
greater		
the		
chance		
the		
crowd		
would		
depersonalize		
them		 
;		
to		
see		
them		
as		
objects		
and		
not		
people		 
.		 
"		 
Dallas		   
'		
Geron		
also		
emphasizes		
personalization		 
,		
pointing		
out		
that		
when		
police		
show		
up		
in		
full		
riot		
garb		 
,		
especially		
gear		
that		
covers		
their		
faces		 
,		
they		
dehumanize		
themselves		
to		
protesters		 
.		 
This		 
is		
especially		
dangerous		
when		
the		
protests		
are		
against		
the		
police		
themselves		 
,		
as		
was		
the		
case		
in		
Ferguson		 
.		 
"		  
You		
make		
all		
of		
your		
officers		
look		
like		
one		
another		 
.		 
To		 
the		
protesters		 
,		
to		
the		
people		 
,		
your		
officers		
are		
no		
longer		
individual		
human		
beings		
with		
faces		 
.		 
You		 
've		
just		
made		
each		
of		
them		
a		
faceless		
symbol		
of		
the		
police		
institution		
that		
the		
protesters		
are		
reacting		
against		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
police		
in		
Ferguson		
are		
almost		
a		
textbook		
example		
of		
how		
not		
to		
react		
to		
protest		 
.		 
"		  
When		
you		
start		
by		
rolling		
out		
the		
SWAT		
team		 
,		
and		
you		
then		
position		
a		
sniper		
on		
top		
of		
an		
APC		
with		
his		
gun		
pointed		
at		
the		
protesters		 
,		
what		
kind		
of		
message		
are		
you		
sending		 
?		 
Did		 
they		
really		
expect		
the		
sniper		
would		
need		
to		
start		
shooting		
people		 
?		 
It		 
was		
just		
a		
show		
of		
force		 
,		 
"		
Geron		
says		 
.		 
He		 
adds		
that		
it		
's		
particularly		
important		
for		
police		
leaders		
to		
prepare		
their		
officers		
when		
the		
protests		
are		
aimed		
at		
police		 
,		
and		
to		
stress		
the		
importance		
of		
separating		
themselves		
from		
criticism		
directed		
at		
the		
agency		 
,		
or		
at		
policing		
in		
general		 
.		 
"		   
It		
's		
a		
crucial		
conversation		
that		
you		
need		
to		
have		
with		
your		
commanders		
and		
your		
officers		 
,		 
"		
he		
says		 
.		 
"		  
You		
have		
to		
tell		
them		
that		
it		
is		
n't		
personal		
'		 
They		
're		
going		
to		
be		
critical		
of		
us		 
.		 
They		 
may		
yell		
at		
us		 
.		 
But		 
that		
's		
OK		 
.		 
That		 
's		
their		
right		 
.		 
And		 
our		
job		
is		
to		
protect		
their		
rights		 
.		  
'		  
"		 
The		  
buzz		
phrase		
in		
policing		
today		
is		
"		 
officer		
safety		 
.		  
"		 
You		
'll		
also		
hear		
lots		
of		
references		
to		
preserving		
order		 
,		
and		
fighting		
wars		 
,		
be		
it		
on		
crime		 
,		
drugs		
or		
terrorism		 
.		 
Those		 
are		
all		
concepts		
that		
emphasize		
confrontation		 
.		 
It		 
's		
a		
view		
that		
pits		
the		
officers		
as		
the		
enforcer		 
,		
and		
the		
public		
as		
the		
entity		
upon		
which		
laws		
and		
policies		
and		
procedures		
are		
to		
be		
enforced		 
.		 
Note		  
the		
contrast		
between		
that		
and		
the		
approaches		
recommended		
by		
Geron		 
,		
Burbank		 
,		
Couper		 
,		
Stamper		
and		
Wilson		 
.		 
They		 
all		
pit		
police		
officers		
not		
as		
enforcers		 
,		
but		
as		
servants		 
.		 
Their		 
primary		
function		
is		
n't		
to		
impose		
order		 
,		
but		
to		
preserve		
and		
protect		
the		
rights		
of		
citizens		 
.		 
In		 
a		
strictly		
academic		
sense		 
,		
preserving		
order		
and		
protecting		
rights		
are		
the		
same		
thing		 
.		 
Operationally		  
,		
they		
're		
radically		
different		
approaches		
to		
policing		 
.
