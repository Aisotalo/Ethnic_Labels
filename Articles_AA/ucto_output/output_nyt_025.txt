--		
Garland		
Moore		 
,		
a		
hospital		
worker		 
,		
lived		
in		
this		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		
for		
much		
of		
his		
33		
years		 
,		
a		
period		
in		
which		
a		
largely		
white		
community		
has		
become		
a		
largely		
black		
one		 
.		 
He		  
attended		
its		
schools		
and		
is		
raising		
his		
family		
in		
this		
place		
of		
suburban		
homes		
and		
apartment		
buildings		
on		
the		
outskirts		
of		
a		
struggling		
Midwest		
city		 
.		 
And		 
over		
time		 
,		
he		
has		
felt		
his		
life		
to		
be		
circumscribed		
by		
Ferguson		
's		
demographics		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Moore		 
,		
who		
is		
black		 
,		
talks		
of		
how		
he		
has		
felt		
the		
wrath		
of		
the		
police		
here		
and		
in		
surrounding		
suburbs		
for		
years		
--		
roughed		
up		
during		
a		
minor		
traffic		
stop		
and		
prevented		
from		
entering		
a		
park		
when		
he		
was		
wearing		
St.		
Louis		
Cardinals		
red		 
.		 
And		  
last		
week		 
,		
as		
he		
stood		
at		
a		
vigil		
for		
an		
unarmed		
18		 
-		
year-old		
shot		
dead		
by		
the		
police		
--		
a		
shooting		
that		
provoked		
renewed		
street		
violence		
and		
looting		
early		
Saturday		
--		
Mr.		
Moore		
heard		
anger		
welling		
and		
listened		
to		
a		
shout		
of		 
:		
"		 
We		
're		
tired		
of		
the		
racist		
police		
department		 
.		 
"		 
"		   
It		
broke		
the		
camel		
's		
back		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Moore		
said		
of		
the		
killing		
of		
the		
teenager		 
,		
Michael		
Brown		 
.		 
Referring		 
to		
the		
northern		
part		
of		
St.		
Louis		
County		 
,		
he		
continued		 
,		
"		 
The		
people		
in		
North		
County		
--		
not		
just		
AfricanAmerican		 
,		
some		
of		
the		
white		
people		 
,		
too		
--		
they		
are		
tired		
of		
the		
police		
harassment		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
origins		
of		
the		
area		
's		
complex		
social		
and		
racial		
history		
date		
to		
the		
19th		
century		
when		
the		
city		
of		
St.		
Louis		
and		
St.		
Louis		
County		
went		
their		
separate		
ways		 
,		
leading		
to		
the		
formation		
of		
dozens		
of		
smaller		
communities		
outside		
St.		
Louis		 
.		 
Missouri		 
itself		
has		
always		
been		
a		
state		
with		
roots		
in		
both		
the		
Midwest		
and		
the		
South		 
,		
and		
racial		
issues		
intensified		
in		
the		
20th		
century		
as		
St.		
Louis		
became		
a		
stopping		
point		
for		
the		
northern		
migration		
of		
Southern		
blacks		
seeking		
factory		
jobs		
in		
Detroit		
and		
Chicago		 
.		 
As		  
AfricanAmerican		
moved		
into		
the		
city		
and		
whites		
moved		
out		 
,		
real		
estate		
agents		
and		
city		
leaders		 
,		
in		
a		
pattern		
familiar		
elsewhere		
in		
the		
country		 
,		
conspired		
to		
keep		
blacks		
out		
of		
the		
suburbs		
through		
the		
use		
of		
zoning		
ordinances		
and		
restrictive		
covenants		 
.		 
But		 
by		
the		
1970		 
s		 
,		
some		
of		
those		
barriers		
had		
started		
to		
fall		 
,		
and		
whites		
moved		
even		
farther		
away		
from		
the		
city		 
.		 
These		 
days		 
,		
Ferguson		
is		
like		
many		
of		
the		
suburbs		
around		
St.		
Louis		 
,		
inner-ring		
towns		
that		
accommodated		
white		
flight		
decades		
ago		
but		
that		
are		
now		
largely		
black		 
.		 
And		 
yet		
they		
retain		
a		
white		
power		
structure		 
.		 
Although		  
about		
two-thirds		
of		
Ferguson		
residents		
are		
black		 
,		
its		
mayor		
and		
five		
of		
its		
six		
City		
Council		
members		
are		
white

Only		 
three		
of		
the		
town

Turnout		  
for		
local		
elections		
in

has		
been		
poor

The		 
mayor		 
,		
James		
W.		
Knowles		
III		 
,		
noted		
his		
disappointment		
with		
the		
turnout		
--		
about		
12		
percent		
--		
in		
the		
most		
recent		
mayoral		
election		
during		
a		
City		
Council		
meeting

April

Bynes		 
,		
a		
black		
woman		
who		
is		
the		
Democratic		
committeewoman		
for		
the		
Ferguson		
area		 
,		
said		
the		
lack		
of		
black		
involvement		
in		
local		
government		
was		
partly		
the		
result		
of		
the		
black		
population		
's		
being		
more		
transient		
in		
small		
municipalities		
and		
less		
attached		
to		
them		 
.		 
There		  
is		
also		
some		
frustration		
among		
blacks		
who		
say		
town		
government		
is		
not		
attuned		
to		
their		
concerns

that		
would		
warn

a		
deaf		
family		
lived		
on		
that

But		 
the

never		
came

"		 
Mr.		  
Moore		 
,		
who		
recently		
moved		
to		
neighboring		
Florissant		 
,		
said		
he		
had		
attended		
a		
couple		
of		
Ferguson		
Council		
meetings		
to		
complain		
that		
the		
police		
should		
be		
patrolling		
the		
residential		
streets		
to		
try		
to		
prevent		
break-ins		
rather		
than		
lying		
in		
wait		
to		
catch		
people		
for		
traffic		
violations		 
.		 
This		  
year		 
,		
community		
members		
voiced		
anger		
after		
the		
all-white		 
,		
seven-member		
school		
board		
for		
the		
Ferguson-Florissant		
district		
pushed		
aside		
its		
black		
superintendent		
for		
unrevealed		
reasons		 
.		 
That		 
spurred		
several		
blacks		
to		
run		
for		
three		
board		
positions		
up		
for		
election		 
,		
but		
only		
one		
won		
a		
seat		 
.		 
The		  
St.		
Louis		
County		
Police		
Department		
fired		
a		
white		
lieutenant		
last		
year		
for		
ordering		
officers		
to		
target		
blacks		
in		
shopping		
areas		 
.		 
That		 
resulted		
in		
the		
department		
's		
enlisting		
researchers		
at		
the		
University		
of		
California		 
,		
Los		
Angeles		 
,		
to		
study		
whether		
the		
department		
was		
engaging		
in		
racial		
profiling		 
.		 
And		  
in		
recent		
years		 
,		
two		
school		
districts		
in		
North		
County		
lost		
their		
accreditation		 
.		 
One		  
,		
Normandy		 
,		
where		
Mr.		
Brown		
graduated		
this		
year		 
,		
serves		
parts		
of		
Ferguson		 
.		 
When		 
parents		
in		
the		
mostly		
black		
district		
sought		
to		
allow		
their		
children		
to		
transfer		
to		
schools		
in		
mostly		
white		
districts		 
,		
they		
said		 
,		
they		
felt		
a		
backlash		
with		
racial		
undertones		 
.		 
Frustration		 
with		
underfunded		
and		
underperforming		
schools		
has		
long		
been		
a		
problem		 
,		
and		
when		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		
held		
a		
news		
conference		
on		
Friday		
to		
discuss		
safety		
and		
security		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
he		
was		
confronted		
with		
angry		
residents		
demanding		
to		
know		
what		
he		
would		
do		
to		
fix		
their		
schools		 
.		 
Ferguson		  
's		
economic		
shortcomings		
reflect		
the		
struggles		
of		
much		
of		
the		
region		 
.		 
Its		 
median		
household		
income		
of		
about		
$	CURRENCY	 
37,000		
is		
less		
than		
the		
statewide		
number		 
,		
and		
its		
poverty		
level		
of		
22		
percent		
outpaces		
the		
state		
's		
by		
seven		
percentage		
points		 
.		 
In		  
Ferguson		 
,		
residents		
say		
most		
racial		
tensions		
have		
to		
do		
with		
an		
overzealous		
police		
force		 
.		 
"		   
It		
is		
the		
people		
in		
a		
position		
of		
authority		
in		
our		
community

come		
forward

"		   
What		
you		
are

"		
Mr.

added

"		  
Sometimes		
things

a		
purpose

we

"		 
Ferguson		  
's		
police		
chief		 
,		
Thomas		
Jackson		 
,		
has		
been		
working		
with		
the		
Justice		
Department		
's		
community		
relations		
team		
on		
improving		
interaction		
with		
residents		 
.		 
At		 
a		
news		
conference		
here		
last		
week		 
,		
he		
acknowledged		
some		
of		
the		
problems		 
.		 
"		   
I		
've		
been		
trying		
to		
increase		
the		
diversity		
of		
the		
department		
ever		
since		
I		
got		
here		 
,		 
"		
Chief		
Jackson		
said		 
,		
adding		
that		
"		 
race		
relations		
is		
a		
top		
priority		
right		
now		 
.		  
"		 
As		
for		
working		
the		
with		
Justice		
Department		 
,		
he		
said		 
,		
"		 
I		
told		
them

'		 
Tell		
me		
what		
to		
do

and		
I		
'll		
do		
it		 
.		  
'		 
"		 
Although		  
experience		
and		
statistics		
suggest		
that		
Ferguson		
's		
police		
force		
disproportionately		
targets		
blacks		 
,		
it		
is		
not		
as		
imbalanced		
as		
in		
some		
neighboring		
departments		
in		
St.		
Louis		
County		 
.		 
While		 
blacks		
are		
37		
percent		
more		
likely		
to		
be		
pulled		
over		
compared		
with		
their		
proportion		
of		
the		
population		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
that		
is		
less		
than		
the		
statewide		
average		
of		
59		
percent		 
,		
according		
to		
Richard		
Rosenfeld		 
,		
a		
professor		
of		
criminology		
at		
the		
University		
of		
Missouri		 
St.		
Louis		 
.		 
In		  
fact		 
,		
Mr.		
Rosenfeld		
said		 
,		
Ferguson		
did		
not		
fit		
the		
profile		
of		
a		
community		
that		
would		
be		
a		
spark		
for		
civil		
unrest		 
.		 
The		 
town		
has		
"		 
pockets		
of		
disadvantage		 
"		
and		
middle		
and		
upper-middle		
income		
families		 
.		 
He		 
said		
Ferguson		
had		
benefited		
in		
the		
last		
five		
to		
10		
years		
from		
economic		
growth		
in		
the		
northern		
part		
of		
the		
county		 
,		
such		
as		
the		
expansion		
of		
Express		
Scripts		 
,		
the		
Fortune		
500		
health		
care		
giant		 
.		 
"		   
Ferguson		
does		
not		
stand		
out		
as		
the		
type		
of		
community		
where		
you		
would		
expect		
tensions		
with		
the		
police		
to		
boil		
over		
into		
violence		
and		
looting		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Rosenfeld		
said		 
.		 
But		  
the		
memory		
of		
the		
region		
's		
racial		
history		
lingers		 
.		 
In		  
1949		 
,		
a		
mob		
of		
whites		
showed		
up		
to		
attack		
blacks		
who		
lined		
up		
to		
get		
into		
the		
pool		
at		
Fairground		
Park		
in		
north		
St.		
Louis		
after		
it		
had		
been		
desegregated		 
.		 
In		  
the		
1970		 
s		 
,		
a		
court		
battle		
over		
public		
school		
inequality		
led		
to		
a		
settlement		
that		
created		
a		
desegregation		
busing		
program		
that		
exists		
to		
this		
day		 
.		 
A		  
Ferguson		
city		
councilman		
caused		
a		
stir		
in		
1970		
when		
he		
used		
racially		
charged		
language		
to		
criticize		
teenagers		
from		
the		
neighboring		
town		
of		
Kinloch		
for		
throwing		
rocks		
and		
bottles		
at		
homes		
in		
Ferguson		 
.		 
The		 
councilman		 
,		
Carl		
Kersting		 
,		
said		 
,		
"		 
We		
should		
call		
a		
black		
a		
black		 
,		
and		
not		
be		
afraid		
to		
face		
up		
to		
these		
people		 
,		 
"		
according		
to		
an		
article		
in		
the		
St.		
Louis		
Globe-Democrat		 
.		 
Eventually		  
blacks		
broke		
down		
the		
barriers		
in		
the		
inner		
ring		
of		
suburbs		 
,		
and		
whites		
fled		
farther		
out		 
.		 
But		 
whites		
fought		
hard		
to		
protect		
their		
turf		 
.		 
In		  
the		
mid		 
-1970		 
s		 
,		
Alyce		
Herndon

She

some

white		
neighbors		
stuck		
an		
Afro		
pick		
in		
their		
front		
lawn

set		
it		
on		
fire

Ms.

recalled		
tensions

school		
after		
the		
television		
mini-series

aired		
in		
1977

For		  
all		
its		
segregation		
and		
discrimination		 
,		
St.		
Louis		
did		
not		
have		
the		
major		
riots		
and		
unrest		
during		
the		
1960

was		
seen		
across

she		
moved		
her

She		 
has		
not		
experienced		
the		
racial		
tensions		
of		
her		
childhood		
in		
St.		
Louis		
County		 
,		
she		
said		 
,		
but		
she		
understands		
that		
the		
younger		
generation		
is		
living		
a		
different		
experience		
than		
she		
is		 
.		 
"		   
I		
understand		
the		
anger		
because		
it		
's		
psychological		
trauma		
when		
you		
see		
so		
many		
people		
being		
shot		
or		
people		
being		
falsely		
accused		 
,

said		
Ms.		
Herndon		 
,		
who		
over		
the		
past		
week		
has		
avoided		
the		
streets		
that		
have		
been		
filled		
with		
tear		
gas		
and		
rubber		
bullets		
in		
clashes		
between		
police		
and		
protesters		 
.		 
But		  
now		 
,		
a		
population		
of		
young		
black		
men		
who		
often		
feel		
forgotten		
actually		
feel		
that		
people		
are		
finally		
listening		 
.		 
"		   
If		
it		
was		
n't		
for		
the		
looting		 
,		 
"		
said		
one		
man

who		
declined		
to		
give		
his		
name

"		 
we		
would		
n't		
get		
the		
attention

"		 
Mr.		  
Moore		
went		
one		
step		
further		 
.		 
He		 
does		
not		
condone		
the		
violence		
that		
erupted		
during		
some		
of		
the		
protests		 
,		
he		
said		 
,		
but		
he		
does		
understand		
the		
frustration		 
.		 
And		 
if		
he		
were		
younger		 
,		
he		
said		 
,		
he		
probably		
would		
have		
joined		
them
