Ferguson		   
,		
U.S.A.		 
It		  
has		
been		
50		
years		
since		
Congress		
passed		
the		
Civil		
Rights		
Act		
of		
1964		 
.		 
Across		 
that		
half		
century		 
,		
the		
condition		
of		
inner-city		
black		
life		
in		
America		
has		
consumed		
immeasurable		
amounts		
of		
the		
nation		
's		
public		
and		
private		
spending		 
,		
litigation		 
,		
academic		
study		 
,		
cultural		
output		
and		
opinion		 
.		 
And		 
yet		
everything		
about		
Ferguson		
is		
familiar		 
.		 
A		  
poor		
neighborhood		
has		
erupted		
over		
a		
police		
killing		 
,		
protesters		
are		
in		
the		
streets		 
,		
civil-rights		
leaders		
are		
everywhere		 
,		
local		
businesses		
have		
been		
looted		
and		
cameramen		
are		
recording		
the		
most		
familiar		
image		
of		
all		
--		
young		
black		
men		
in		
a		
state		
of		
rage		 
.		 
Eventually		 
Ferguson		
will		
subside		
as		
a		
daily		
news		
story		 
,		
and		
then		
life		
in		
this		
small		
town		
in		
the		
middle		
of		
the		
country		
will		
return		
to		
being		
what		
it		
was		 
.		 
What		  
we		
are		
seeing		
in		
Ferguson		
occurred		
on		
a		
larger		
scale		
in		
Detroit		
and		
Newark		
in		
1967		 
,		
in		
the		
Watts		
section		
of		
Los		
Angeles		
in		
1965		 
,		
and		
in		
a		
neighborhood		
called		
Hough		
on		
the		
east		
side		
of		
Cleveland		
in		
1966		 
.		 
Some		 
argue		
that		
Detroit		
and		
Newark		
never		
recovered		 
.		 
We		  
will		
leave		
it		
to		
others		
to		
plumb		
the		
riddles		
of		
whether		
racism		
and		
injustice		
create		
the		
Fergusons		
of		
America		 
.		 
A		 
question		
more		
open		
to		
the		
possibility		
of		
an		
answer		
is		 
:		
Why		
do		
n't		
more		
young		
guys		
in		
places		
like		
Ferguson		
have		
a		
job		
to		
occupy		
their		
days		 
?		 
The		  
short		
answer		
is		 
,		
they		
do		
n't		
work		
because		
there		
is		
no		
work		 
.		 
And		 
anyway		 
,		
who		
would		
hire		
them		 
?		 
President		 
Barack
