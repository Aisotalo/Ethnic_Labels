Testimony		  
shows		
seemingly		
unorthodox		
forensic		
practices		 
When		  
police		
officer		
Darren		
Wilson		
left		
the		
Ferguson		 
,		
Missouri		
scene		
of		
the		
shooting		
of		
unarmed		
teenager		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
the		
officer		
returned		
to		
the		
police		
station		
unescorted		 
,		
washed		
blood		
off		
his		
hands		
and		
placed		
his		
recently		
fired		
pistol		
into		
an		
evidence		
bag		
himself		 
.		 
Those		  
actions		 
,		
described		
in		
grand		
jury		
testimony		 
,		
violated		
protocols		
for		
how		
to		
handle		
a		
crime		
scene		
and		
secure		
evidence		 
,		
according		
to		
experts		
in		
policing		
procedures		
and		
Justice		
Department		
documents		 
.		 
Wilson		  
's		
movements		
after		
the		
shooting		
were		
among		
a		
number		
of		
police		
actions		
in		
the		
aftermath		
of		
Brown		
's		
death		
that		
experts		
said		
were		
unusual		 
.		 
The		 
grand		
jury		
transcripts		
revealed		 
,		
for		
example		 
,		
that		
officers		
who		
interviewed		
Wilson		
immediately		
after		
the		
shooting		
did		
not		
tape		
the		
conversations		 
.		 
They		 
also		
showed		
that		
an		
investigator		
from		
the		
medical		
examiner		
's		
office		
opted		
not		
to		
take		
measurements		
at		
the		
crime		
scene		 
,		
and		
arrived		
there		
believing		
that		
what		
happened		
between		
Brown		
and		
Wilson		
was		
"		 
self-explanatory		 
.		 
"		 
It		  
is		
unclear		
how		
these		
unorthodox		
practices		
may		
have		
influenced		
the		
investigation		
of		
a		
shooting		
that		
has		
triggered		
a		
national		
conversation		
about		
race		
and		
police		
practices		 
.		 
The		 
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
Monday		
not		
to		
indict		
Wilson		
in		
connection		
with		
the		
shooting		
death		
has		
led		
to		
protests		
nationwide		 
.		 
Police		  
and		
forensic		
officials		
in		
Ferguson		
have		
not		
responded		
to		
repeated		
requests		
for		
comment		
over		
a		
two-day		
period		 
.		 
In		  
the		
critical		
first		
minutes		
after		
a		
shooting		 
,		
investigators		
are		
trained		
to		
follow		
a		
time-tested		
process		
of		
protecting		
the		
scene		
to		
ensure		
evidence		
is		
not		
compromised		 
,		
according		
to		
the		
experts		
and		
documents		 
.		 
A		 
shooting		
suspect		
-		
even		
a		
police

what		
experts		
said		
was		
perhaps		
the		
most		
serious		
breach		
of		
proper		
protocol		
after		
Brown		
was		
killed

The

spells		
out		
in

how

Among		 
the		
most		
important		
aspects

the		
manual		
said		 
:		
securing

as		
"		 
totally		
unorthodox

unusual

This		 
would		
be		
considered		
very		
out

very		
very		
bad		
from		
an		
investigative		
perspective

Drago		  
said		
investigators		
are		
supposed		
to		
immediately		
seize		
a		
suspect

even		
that

Wilson

at

The		 
FBI		
had		
a		
controversial		
policy		
for		
years		
of		
not		
taping		
witness		
interviews

Drago

said		
Wilson		
might		
not		
have		
followed		
proper		
procedure		
because		
it		
was		
the		
first		
time		
he		
had		
fired

the		
circumstances

taking		
care		
to		
package		
his

who		
was

named

was		
described		
as		
a		
25

year		
veteran

did		
not		
take		
his		
own		
photographs		
at

up

presented		
by

one		
else

blood

not		
about		
preserving		
evidence

"		   
His		
concern		
was		
not		
of

hazards		
it

attract

the

was		
not		
identified

In		  
the		
extended		
interviews		 
,		
prosecutors		
questioned		
police		
procedures		
on		
a		
couple		
of		
occasions		 
,		
including		
the		
decisions		
by		
Ferguson		
and		
St.		
Louis		
County		
investigators		
not		
to		
tape		
their		
interviews		
with		
the		
officer		
after		
the		
shooting

Why		  
not		
tape		
these		
answers		 
?		 
a		 
detective		
with		
St.		
Louis		
County		
was		
asked		 
.		 
"		  
It		
is		
just		
common		
practice		
that		
we		
do		
not		 
,		 
"		
the		
detective		
said		 
.		 
Prosecutors		  
also		
asked		
why		
Wilson		
was		
permitted		
to		
handle		
evidence		
in		
the		
case		
himself		 
.		 
"		  
He		
had		
informed		
me		
that		
after		
he		
responded		
to		
the		
police		
station

he		
had		
packaged		
his		
weapon

directed		
my		
attention		
to		
an		
evidence		
envelope

said		
a		
St.		
Louis		
County		
detective		 
.		 
Is		 
it		
customary		
for		
the		
person		
who		
was		
involved		
in		
such		
an		
incident

to		
handle		
and		
package		
their		
own		
gun		
as		
evidence		 
?		  
"		 
the		
detective		
was		
asked		 
.		 
Not		  
according		
to		
the		
rules		
of		
the		
St.		
Louis		
County		
Police		
Department		 
,		
the		
detective		
said		 
.		 
But		 
Ferguson		
may		
have		
had		
its		
own		
rules		 
,		
the		
detective		
said		 
.		 
He		 
was		
not		
aware		
of		
"		 
any		
policies		
or		
procedures		
they		
have		
in		
place		 
"		
on		
the		
topic		 
,		
and		
Ferguson		
officials		
have		
declined		
to		
address		
the		
subject		 
.		 
Despite		  
Wilson		
's		
unorthodox		
practices		 
,		
transcripts		
appear		
to		
show		
that		
prosecutors		
treated		
him		
with		
greater		
deference		
than		
they		
showed		
some		
other		
grand		
jury		
witnesses		 
.		 
Prosecutors		   
,		
who		
led		
the		
inquiry		 
,		
regularly		
grilled		
witnesses		 
,		
testing		
their		
memories		
and		
going		
to		
great		
lengths		
to		
discredit		
some		 
.		 
But		  
in		
questioning		
Wilson		 
,		
prosecutors		
were		
far		
more		
gentle		
and		
at		
times		
seemed		
to		
be		
guiding		
his		
answers		 
.		 
At		  
one		
point		 
,		
a		
prosecutor		
asks		
Wilson		 
:		
"		 
So		
you		
got		
out		
of		
the		
car		 
,		
you		
are		
running		 
,		
you		
are		
telling		
(		 
Brown		 
)		
to		
stop		 
;		
is		
that		
right		 
?		 
"		   
Correct		 
,		 
"		
Wilson		
responds		 
.		 
"		   
And		
he		
's		
not		
listening		 
?		  
"		 
the		
prosecutor		
asks		 
.		 
"		   
No		 
,		 
"		
Wilson		
says		 
.		 
At		  
another		
point		 
,		
a		
prosecutor		
tells		
Wilson		
he		
does		
n't		
want		
to		
"		 
put		
words		
in		
your		
mouth		 
"		
even		
while		
asking		
that		 
,		
as		
Brown		
was		
allegedly		
striking		
the		
officer		
in		
the		
face		
as		
he		
sat		
in		
his		
police		
car		 
,		
"		 
it		
was		
your		
opinion		
that		
you		
needed		
to		
pull		
out		
your		
weapon		 
?		 
"		 
"		   
I		
felt		
another		
one		
one		
of		
those		
punches		
in		
my		
face		
could		
knock		
me		
out		
or		
worse		 
,		 
"		
Wilson		
testified		 
.		 
"		  
I		
mean		 
,		
it		
was		 
,		
he		
's		
obviously		
biger		
than		
I		
was		
and		
stronger		
and		
I		
've		
already		
taken		
two		
to		
the		
face

.		
.

the		
third		
one		
could		
be		
fatal		
if		
it		
hit
