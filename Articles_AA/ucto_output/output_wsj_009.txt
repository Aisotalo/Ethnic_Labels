More		
Officers		
Wearing		
Body		
Cameras		 
More		  
police		
departments		
are		
outfitting		
policemen		
with		
wearable		
cameras		
that		
tape		
what		
officers		
see		
as		
they		
do		
their		
job		 
,		
providing		
a		
record		
in		
the		
aftermath		
of		
incidents		
like		
the		
one		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
,		
where		
a		
policeman		
shot		
and		
killed		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teen		 
.		 
The		  
cameras		
have		
shown		
promise		
in		
reducing		
incidents		
involving		
use		
of		
force		
as		
well		
as		
citizen		
complaints		 
,		
according		
to		
new		
studies		 
.		 
Worn		 
on		
officers		 
'		
lapels		 
,		
glasses		
or		
hats		 
,		
the		
cameras		
can		
document		
a		
more		
definitive		
version		
of		
police		
work		 
.		 
"		   
If		
you		
look		
at		
what		
's		
happening		
in		
Ferguson		
--		
basically		
you		
have		
two		
entirely		
different		
versions		
of		
events		 
,		 
"		
said		
Michael		
White		 
,		
a		
professor		
of		
criminology		
at		
Arizona		
State		
University		 
.		 
"		  
If		
that		
officer		
was		
wearing		
a		
body-worn		
camera		
we		
could		
just		
go		
to		
the		
tape		 
.

In		  
a		
press		
conference		
earlier		
this		
week		 
,		
Thomas		
Jackson		 
,		
chief		
of		
the		
Ferguson		
police		
department		 
,		
said		
the		
department		
had		
only		
recently		
been		
budgeted		
$	CURRENCY	 
5,000		
to		
buy		
a		
limited		
number		
of		
dashboard		
cameras		
and		
body		
cameras		
for		
officers		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Jackson		
said		
the		
department		
had		
not		
yet		
put		
them		
into		
use		
at		
the		
time		
of		
the		
shooting		
but		
plans		
on		
incorporating		
them		
into		
vehicles		
and		
on		
officers		
soon		 
.		 
In		  
the		
Southern		
California		
city		
of		
Rialto		 
,		
the		
number		
of		
citizen		
complaints		
against		
police		
dropped		
from		
24		
to		
3		
in		
the		
first		
year		
that		
the		
patrol		
officers		
began		
wearing		
cameras		
in		
2012		 
.		 
Use-of-force		 
incidents		
plummeted		
from		
61		
to		
25		
during		
the		
same		
period		 
.		 
Tony		  
Farrar		 
,		
Rialto		
's		
chief		
of		
police		
said		 
,		
"		 
When		
you		
talk		
about		
putting		
a		
camera		
on		
somebody		 
,		
human		
nature		
is		
going		
to		
dictate		
that		
you		
're		
going		
mind		
your		
p		
's		
and		
q		
's		
and		
you		
're		
going		
to		
be		
on		
the		
best		
behavior		 
.		 
"		 
"		   
At		
the		
same		 
,		
I		
think		
it		
's		
had		
an		
impact		
on		
citizens		
--		
if		
they		
know		
you		
're		
wearing		
a		
camera		
they		
too		
will		
be		
on		
their		
best		
behavior		 
,

A		  
2013		
study		
found		
that		
a		
quarter		
of		
254		
U.S.		
police		
departments		
surveyed		
used		
body		
cameras		 
,		
according		
to		
the		
Police		
Executive		
Research		
Forum		 
.		 
More		 
than		
1,200		
law		
enforcement		
agencies		
have		
purchased		
wearable		
cameras		
from		
Taser		
International		
Inc.		 
,		
with		
about		
80		 
%		
of		
the		
company		
's		
camera		
sales		
occurring		
in		
the		
last		
12		
months		 
,		
according		
to		
Taser		
spokesman		
Steve		
Tuttle		 
.		 
Big		  
city		
police		
departments		
have		
begun		
to		
use		
or		
test		
body		
cameras		 
,		
including		
New		
Orleans		 
,		
Los		
Angeles		
and		
Las		
Vegas		 
.		 
There		  
also		
has		
been		
some		
resistance		 
.		 
The		  
police		
union		
in		
Las		
Vegas		
initially		
opposed		
using		
body		
cameras		 
,		
worrying		
that		
the		
footage		
could		
be		
used		
in		
fishing		
expeditions		
against		
officers		
in		
cases		
where		
there		
were		
no		
complaints		 
,		
said		
Chris		
Collins		 
,		
the		
union		
's		
executive		
director		 
.		 
Now		  
,		
some		
Las		
Vegas		
police		
have		
begun		
wearing		
them		
after		
the		
union		
and		
the		
department		
hammered		
out		
guidelines		 
.		 
Police		  
body		
cameras		
also		
have		
sparked		
privacy		
concerns		
for		
citizens		 
,		
but		
civil		
liberties		
groups		
back		
their		
use		
with		
some		
restrictions		 
.		 
The		  
American		
Civil		
Liberties		
Union		
said		
last		
year		
that		
the		
cameras		
have		
the		
"		 
potential		
to		
be		
a		
win-win		 
,		
helping		
protect		
the		
public		
against		
police		
misconduct		 
,		
and		
at		
the		
same		
time		
helping		
protect		
police		
against		
false		
accusations		
of		
abuse		 
.		 
"		 
The		  
cameras		
themselves		
are		
only		
part		
of		
the		
expense		
--		
Taser		
's		
cameras		
range		
from		
$	CURRENCY	 
399		
to		
$	CURRENCY	 
599		 
.		 
Data-storage		 
and		
management		
costs		
can		
be		
significant
