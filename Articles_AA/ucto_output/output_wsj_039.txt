Civil		
Rights		
Case		
Is		
Seen		
As		
Difficult		
To		
Bring		 
WASHINGTON		  
--		
Attorney		
General		
Eric		
Holder		
said		
Tuesday		
the		
government		
would		
try		
to		
help		
identify		
"		 
criminal		
elements		 
"		
behind		
the		
rioting		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
,		
following		
a		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
not		
to		
indict		
a		
white		
police		
officer		
in		
the		
shooting		
of		
an		
unarmed		
black		
man		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Holder		
promised		
a		
thorough		
and		
independent		
federal		
civil		
rights		
probe		
of		
the		
Aug.		
9		
shooting		
of		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
18		
years		
old		 
,		
by		
Officer		
Darren		
Wilson		 
.		 
The		 
Justice		
Department		
is		
likely		
several		
weeks		
away		
from		
deciding		
whether		
to		
file		
charges		
against		
the		
officer		 
,		
according		
to		
officials		 
.		 
Legal		  
observers		
say		
bringing		
civil		
rights		
charges		
against		
Mr.		
Wilson		
would		
be		
difficult		
since		
the		
standard		
is		
higher		
for		
a		
federal		
case		
than		
for		
a		
state		
criminal		
prosecution		 
.		 
Under		  
federal		
civil		
rights		
law		 
,		
Justice		
Department		
prosecutors		
would		
have		
to		
show		
that		
Mr.		
Wilson		
intended		
to		
deprive		
the		
victim		
of		
his		
civil		
rights		
in		
their		
confrontation		 
.		 
"		   
The		
willfulness		
requirement		
makes		
it		
especially		
hard		
to		
prove		
these		
cases		 
,		 
"		 
"		
said		
Samuel		
Bagenstos		 
,		
a		
former		
top		
civil		
rights		
official		
in		
the		
Justice		
Department		
who		
now		
teaches		
law		
at		
the		
University		
of		
Michigan		 
.		 
"		  
I		
would		
n't		
have		
very		
high		
expectations		 
.		  
"		  
"		 
The		  
prosecutors		
would		
n't		
have		
to		
show		
Mr.		
Wilson		
acted		
with		
racial		
animus		 
,		
but		
they		
would		
have		
to		
show		
Mr.		
Brown		
did		
n't		
pose		
a		
threat		 
,		
and		
that		
a		
reasonable		
police		
officer		
in		
the		
same		
situation		
would		
have		
realized		
Mr.		
Brown		
was		
n't		
a		
threat		 
.		 
The		  
Justice		
Department		
has		
opened		
a		
"		 
pattern		
and		
practice		 
"		 
"		
probe		
of		
the		
53		 
-		 
employee		
Ferguson		
police		
department		 
,		
looking		
for		
flaws		
in		
training		 
,		
hiring		 
,		
stops		 
,		
use		
of		
force		 
,		
and		
other		
areas		 
.		 
Such		 
probes		
are		
n't		
designed		
to		
bring		
criminal		
charges		 
,		
but		
to		
identify		
departments		
whose		
practices		
need		
improvement		 
.		 
Any		 
outcome		
of		
that		
probe		
is		
likely		
months		
away		 
,		
according		
to		
officials		 
.
