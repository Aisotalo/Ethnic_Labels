"		
Mr.		
Cuomo		
said		 
,		
adding		 
:		
"		 
I		
think		
we		
should		
look		
at		
the		
whole		
system

it		
's		
not		
going		
to		
be		
one		
quick

The

supported

a

Like		
all		
New

I		
am

are		
with

Mr.		
Skelos		
said		 
,		
referring		
to		
Mr.		
Garner		 
.		 
"		  
The		
job		
of		
law		
enforcement		
is		
very		
difficult

It		 
is		
important		
that		
all		
New		
Yorkers		
feel		
confident		
in		
our		
criminal		
justice		
system		
and		
that		
they		
believe		
that		
we		
are		
all		
treated		
equally

State		  
Sen.		
Marty

as		
far

I		
'm		
concerned

the

system		
worked		 
"		
in		
the		
Garner		
case

Mr.		 
Golden		
said		
he		
did		
n't		
believe		
the		
criminal		
justice		
system		
required		
reform		
but		
would		
wait		
to		
see		
specific		
proposals		
before		
determining		
his		
position		
on		
them

"		   
It		
's		
always		
good		
to		
look		
at		
legislation		
in		
an		
area		
you		
have		
n't		
looked		
at		
in		
a		
long		
time

"		  
I		
'm		
not

In		  
an		
interview

Randolph		  
McLaughlin		 
,		
a		
professor		
at

School		
of		
Law		 
,		
said		
special		
prosecutors		
should		
be		
brought		
in		
when		
a		
case		
involving		
a		
police		
officer		
goes		
before		
a		
grand		
jury		 
.		 
"		   
You		
lose		
a		
certain		
level		
of		
objectivity		
when		
prosecutors		
are		
called		
upon		
to		
investigate		
their		
own		
colleagues		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
McLaughlin		
said		 
,		
adding		
that		
a		
special		
prosecutor		
"		 
enhances		
public		
confidence		
to		
have		
a		
neutral		
person		 
.		 
"		 
Mr.		  
Cuomo		
could		
institute		
some		
changes		
through		
the		
budget		
process		 
,		
rather		
than		
by		
introducing		
legislation		 
,		
said		
Gerald		
Benjamin		 
,		
a		
professor		
of		
political		
science		
at		
SUNY		
New		
Paltz		 
.		 
The		  
governor		
could		
increase		
funding		
for		
equipment		
or		
police		
training		
in		
the		
budget		 
,		
Mr.		
Benjamin		
said		 
.		 
But		  
other		
changes		 
,		
he		
said		 
,		
such		
as		
statutory		
changes		
to		
the		
power		
of		
district		
attorneys		 
,		
would		
require		
legislative		
action
