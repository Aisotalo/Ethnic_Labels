President		
Faces		
Limits		
in		
Local		
Oversight		 
WASHINGTON		  
--		
The		
deaths		
of		
unarmed		
AfricanAmerican		
men		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
,		
and		
New		
York		
City		
at		
the		
hands		
of		
white		
police		
officers		
have		
sparked		
a		
debate		
over		
deadly		
force		
while		
highlighting		
Washington		
's		
limits		
in		
dealing		
with		
local		
police		
issues		 
.		 
The		  
nation		
's		
first		
black		
president		
and		
first		
black		
attorney		
general		
have		
been		
outspoken		
about		
their		
concerns		
surrounding		
the		
shooting		
death		
of		
Michael		
Brown		
in		
Ferguson		
and		
the		
apparent		
choking		
death		
of		
Eric		
Garner		
on		
Staten		
Island		 
.		 
In		 
the		
span		
of		
two		
weeks		 
,		
grand		
juries		
decided		
not		
to		
file		
charges		
against		
the		
officers		
involved		 
.		 
But		  
the		
overall		
response		
from		
Washington		
has		
been		
restrained		 
.		 
President		 
Barack		
Obama		
has		
addressed		
the		
racially		
charged		
issues		
from		
a		
distance		 
,		
speaking		
in		
general		
terms		
about		
the		
distrust		
between		
law		
enforcement		
and		
minority		
communities		 
.		 
Both		  
Mr.		
Obama		
and		
Attorney		
General		
Eric		
Holder		
have		
committed		
to		
improving		
relations		
between		
police		
and		
minority		
groups		
and		
called		
for		
more		
money		
to		
outfit		
police		
with		
cameras		
that		
record		
their		
actions		
and		
a		
commission		
to		
study		
the		
issue		 
.		 
The		 
Justice		
Department		
is		
investigating		
several		
police		
departments		 
,		
including		
Ferguson		 
's		 
,		
for		
patterns		
of		
abuse		
or		
misconduct		
and		
is		
conducting		
its		
own		
civil-rights		
probes		
of		
the		
deaths		
of		
Messrs.		
Brown		
and		
Garner		 
.		 
But		  
those		
investigations		
face		
a		
fairly		
high		
hurdle		
given		
that		
the		
legal		
standard		
for		
civil-rights		
charges		
requires		
proof		
of		
willful		
intent		
on		
the		
officer		
's		
part		
to		
violate		
someone		
's		
civil		
rights		 
.		 
There		  
are		
also		
political		
reasons		
prompting		
the		
administration		
to		
tread		
cautiously		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Obama		
has		
nominated		
Loretta		
Lynch		 
,		
the		
U.S.		
attorney		
in		
Brooklyn		 
,		
N		 
.		  
Y		  
.		  
,		 
to		
succeed		
Mr.		
Holder		
as		
attorney		
general		 
.		 
Ms.		  
Lynch		
's		
office		
is		
overseeing		
the		
federal		
civil-rights		
probe		
of		
Mr.		
Garner		
's		
death		 
,		
which		
could		
complicate		
her		
confirmation		 
.		 
The		  
powerful		
National		
Fraternal		
Order		
of		
Police		
union		
--		
which		
has		
yet		
to		
decide		
whether		
to		
support		
Ms.		
Lynch		
--		
said		
any		
decision		
on		
the		
Garner		
case		
"		 
would		
certainly		
be		
a		
factor		
in		
whether		
or		
not		
we		
supported		
her		
nomination		 
,		 
"		
according		
to		
James		
Pasco		 
,		
its		
executive		
director		 
.		 
Several		  
officials		
said		
they		
do		
n't		
expect		
Ms.		
Lynch		
to		
decide		
whether		
to		
indict		
the		
officer		
in		
the		
Garner		
case		
before		
her		
confirmation		
hearings		
next		
year		 
.		 
White		  
House		
press		
secretary		
Josh		
Earnest		
has		
declined		
to		
say		
whether		
the		
president		
thinks		
the		
grand		
jury		
in		
Staten		
Island		
made		
the		
wrong		
decision		 
.		 
He		 
has		
seen		
the		
video		
showing		
police		
with		
Mr.		
Garner		
in		
a		
chokehold		 
,		
the		
White		
House		
said		 
.		 
The		 
officer		 
,		
Daniel		
Pantaleo		 
,		
was		
trying		
to		
arrest		
Mr.		
Garner		
for		
allegedly		
selling		
untaxed		
cigarettes
