Amid		  
violence		 
,		
police		
react		
with		
restraint		
not		
shown		
after		
August		
killing		 
FERGUSON		   
,		
Mo.		
--		
The		
night		
of		
smoke		 
,		
fire		 
,		
looting		
and		
chaos		
began		
not		
so		
much		
with		
an		
event		 
,		
but		
a		
sound		 
.		 
Pop-pop-pop		   
.		 
Gunfire		   
.		 
Until		  
then		 
,		
the		
scene		
outside		
the		
police		
station		
where		
hundreds		
of		
demonstrators		
had		
assembled		
was		
tense		
but		
civil		 
.		 
The		 
moment		
that		
many		
feared		
the		
most		
--		
the		
instant		
when		
the		
crowd		
learned		
that		
a		
grand		
jury		
declined		
to		
indict		
a		
white		
police		
officer		
for		
killing		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		
in		
August		
--		
had		
passed		 
,		
angrily		
but		
uneventfully		 
.		 
The		 
crowd		 
,		
shouting		
expletives		
to		
the		
officers		
who		
formed		
a		
line		
behind		
metal		
barricades		 
,		
surged		
forward		 
,		
attempting		
to		
push		
down		
the		
barriers		 
.		 
One		 
police		
commander		 
,		
not		
in		
riot		
gear		 
,		
rushed		
in		
to		
help		
calm		
the		
protesters		
at		
the		
line		 
.		 
Several		  
minutes		
passed		 
,		
and		
a		
standoff		
played		
out		
in		
this		
city		
's		
historic		
red-brick		
downtown		
shopping		
corridor		 
,		
beneath		
the		
red		
bows		
and		
holiday		
lights		
strung		
around		
the		
light		
poles		 
.		 
The		 
police		 
,		
whose		
handling		
of		
the		
protests		
after		
the		
shooting		
in		
August		
was		
widely		
criticized		
as		
heavy-handed		
and		
abusive		 
,		
showed		
restraint		 
,		
and		
the		
protesters		 
,		
though		
visibly		
angry		 
,		
stopped		
trying		
to		
surge		
past		
the		
gates		 
.		 
And		  
then		
the		
gunshots		
rang		
out		 
,		
about		
a		
block		
from		
the		
station		
on		
South		
Florissant		
Road		 
.		 
People		  
scattered		
in		
panic		 
.		 
A		 
number		
of		
protesters		
broke		
off		
from		
the		
main		
group		
and		
marched		
to		
the		
stretch		
of		
closed		
shops		
where		
the		
gunfire		
had		
come		
from		 
.		 
There		  
,		
groups		
of		
young		
men		
tried		
tipping		
over		
a		
police		
car		 
.		 
They		 
beat		
the		
doors		
and		
shattered		
its		
windows		 
.		 
They		 
taunted		
and		
shouted		
at		
the		
line		
of		
police		
officers		 
,		
now		
blocking		
their		
progress		
and		
in		
riot		
gear		 
.		 
Others		 
shattered		
the		
windows		
of		
businesses		 
,		
including		
a		
Mexican		
restaurant		 
.		 
And		  
then		
some		
of		
the		
rage		
turned		
against		
the		
police		
themselves		 
.		 
Protesters		 
threw		
rocks		
and		
broken		
bricks		
at		
officers		 
,		
and		
there		
were		
thuds		
and		
slaps		
as		
the		
projectiles		
hit		
the		
officers		 
'		
helmets		
and		
riot		
shields		 
.		 
At		  
first		 
,		
the		
police		
held		
back		
and		
made		
no		
attempt		
to		
clear		
the		
street		 
.		 
One		 
police		
official		
used		
a		
vehicle		
's		
public-address		
system		
to		
tell		
the		
crowd		
to		
disperse		 
.		 
But		 
as		
the		
protesters		
continued		
to		
pummel		
the		
vehicles		
and		
began		
setting		
them		
aflame		 
,		
the		
police		
reacted		 
,		
firing		
the		
first		
rounds		
of		
tear		
gas		 
.		 
So		  
began		
hours		
of		
rioting		
--		
described		
as		
such		
by		
police		
officials		
--		
in		
and		
near		
downtown		
Ferguson		 
.		 
Even		 
as		
the		
police		
had		
initially		
reacted		
with		
less		
aggression		
than		
in		
August		 
,		
when		
a		
white		
officer		
named		
Darren		
Wilson		
fatally		
shot		
Michael		
Brown		 
,		
the		
protesters		
were		
more		
violent		
and		
destructive		 
.		 
By		  
Tuesday		
the		
damage		
became		
clear		 
:		
At		
least		
a		
dozen		
businesses		
were		
destroyed		
or		
damaged		
by		
arson		 
.		 
Other		 
shops		
were		
vandalized		
and		
looted		 
.		 
Firefighters		 
tried		
to		
put		
out		
a		
fire		
at		
a		
storage		
lot		 
,		
but		
they		
retreated		
because		
of		
gunfire		 
.		 
More		 
than		
60		
people		
were		
arrested		 
.		 
"		   
I		
did		
n't		
see		
a		
lot		
of		
peaceful		
protest		
out		
there		
tonight		 
,		
and		
I		
'm		
disappointed		
about		
that		 
,		 
"		
one		
of		
the		
officials		
who		
managed		
the		
police		
response		 
,		
Chief		
Jon		
M.		
Belmar		
of		
the		
St.		
Louis		
County		
Police		
Department		 
,		
told		
reporters		
early		
Tuesday		
morning		 
.		 
"		  
I		
'm		
not		
saying		
there		
were		
n't		
folks		
out		
there		
who		
were		
out		
there		
for		
the		
right		
reason		 
.		 
But		 
I		
am		
saying		
that		
unfortunately		
this		
spun		
out		
of		
control		 
.		 
Frankly		  
,		
what		
I		
've		
seen		
tonight		
is		
probably		
much		
worse		
than		
the		
worst		
night		
we		
ever		
had		
in		
August		 
.		 
"		 
Chief		  
Belmar		
said		
he		
had		
personally		
heard		
about		
150		
shots		
fired		 
.		 
No		 
officers		
fired		
a		
single		
shot		
as		
far		
as		
he		
knew		 
,		
he		
said		 
.		 
Before		  
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
was		
announced		 
,		
the		
police		
had		
made		
tactical		
decisions		
aimed		
at		
de-escalating		
the		
situation		 
,		
a		
sign		
that		
with		
the		
attention		
of		
the		
world		
focused		
on		
how		
they		
conducted		
themselves		 
,		
lessons		
had		
been		
learned		
from		
their		
response		
in		
August		 
.		 
Unlike		 
in		
recent		
days		 
,		
for		
instance		 
,		
the		
police		
allowed		
the		
protesters		
to		
assemble		
on		
the		
street		
and		
block		
traffic		
outside		
the		
police		
station		 
.		 
But		  
their		
restraint		
did		
nothing		
to		
mollify		
the		
enraged		
crowd		 
.		 
And		 
when		
the		
police		
asserted		
themselves		
by		
firing		
they		
succeeded		
only		
in		
pushing		
members		
of		
the		
crowd		
north		 
,		
away		
from		
a		
heavily		
secured		
area		
and		
toward		
a		
busy		
intersection		 
,		
where		
they		
set		
fires		
and		
looted		 
.		 
Earlier		  
in		
the		
day		 
,		
the		
police		
seemed		
to		
have		
a		
strategy		
of		
staying		
out		
of		
sight		 
.		 
There		 
was		
no		
line		
of		
officers		
in		
riot		
gear		
and		
no		
uniformed		
officers		
visible		
in		
the		
area		
around		
the		
Police		
Department		 
,		
dampening		
the		
anger		
of		
some		
protesters		 
.		 
It		 
was		
not		
Us		
vs.		
Them		 
.		 
There		 
was		
no		
Them		 
.		 
Shortly		  
after		
7		
p		 
.		 
m		 
.		  
,		 
the		
crowd		
spilled		
out		
from		
where		
it		
had		
gathered		 
,		
a		
tire-shop		
parking		
lot		
across		
the		
street		
from		
the		
police		
station		 
,		
and		
moved		
onto		
the		
four-lane		
road		 
.		 
In		 
previous		
days		 
,		
the		
police		
had		
arrested		
protesters		
who		
blocked		
traffic		
there		 
.		 
But		 
with		
hundreds		
of		
people		
assembled		 
,		
the		
police		
--		
apparently		
in		
an		
attempt		
to		
avoid		
inciting		
the		
crowd		
--		
allowed		
them		
to		
take		
over		
the		
street		 
.		 
The		  
demonstration		
had		
the		
feel		
of		
a		
block		
party		
at		
this		
early		
moment		 
,		
before		
the		
announcement		
of		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		 
.		 
A		 
woman		
let		
her		
daughter		 
,		
who		
was		
about		
5		 
,		
approach		
the		
barricades		 
.		 
A		 
young		
man		
took		
puffs		
of		
what		
smelled		
like		
a		
marijuana		
joint		 
.		 
Someone		 
blared		
rap		
music		
from		
a		
stereo		
system		
and		
loudspeaker		
on		
a		
dolly		 
.		 
At		  
8		
p		 
.		 
m		 
.		  
,		 
the		
scheduled		
time		
of		
the		
grand		
jury		
announcement		 
,		
only		
about		
nine		
police		
officers		
--		
none		
of		
whom		
wore		
riot		
gear		
--		
formed		
a		
line		
behind		
the		
barricades		 
.		 
There		 
were		
so		
few		
police		
offers		
that		
some		
protesters		
became		
suspicious		 
.		 
"		  
They		
went		
back		
there		
so		
they		
can		
rush		
us		 
,		 
"		
one		
woman		
said		 
.		 
An		  
hour		
or		
so		
later		 
,		
after		
the		
first		
sounds		
of		
gunfire		
and		
the		
first		
volleys		
of		
tear		
gas		 
,		
a		
Little		
Caesars		
pizza		
shop		
was		
in		
flames		 
.		 
Thick		 
smoke		
poured		
out		
the		
busted		
front		
entrance		
of		
a		
nearby		
Walgreens		
pharmacy		 
.		 
One		 
man		
exited		
the		
store		
and		
jokingly		
asked		
aloud		
if		
anyone		
wanted		
cigarettes		 
.		 
It		  
was		
about		
2		
a.m.		
Tuesday		
when		
Chief		
Belmar		
and		
other		
officials		
arrived		
outside		
a		
command		
post		
for		
a		
news		
conference		 
.		 
A		 
pickup		
truck		
was		
part		
of		
the		
police		
convoy		 
.		 
In		 
the		
bed		
of		
the		
truck		 
,		
officials		
had		
put		
some		
of		
the		
rocks		
and		
bricks		
that		
had		
been		
hurled		
at		
them		
and		
their		
vehicles		 
.		 
On		 
the		
tailgate		 
,		
they		
placed		
a		
.45		 
-		 
caliber		
pistol		
that		
had		
been		
confiscated		
from		
a		
protester		 
.		 
At		 
the		
time		
of		
the		
man		
's		
arrest		
on		
South		
Florissant		 
,		
the		
gun		
had		
been		
loaded		 
.		 
There		 
was		
a		
round		
in		
the		
chamber		 
.
