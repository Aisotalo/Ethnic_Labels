Policing		  
Broken		
Lights		 
Four		  
days		
before		
a		
grand		
jury		
refused		
to		
indict		
the		
white		
police		
officer		
who		
shot		
and		
killed		
Michael		
Brown		
during		
an		
encounter		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
,		
in		
August		 
,		
Akai		
Gurley		 
,		
an		
unarmed		
28		 
-		
year-old		
man		 
,		
died		
as		
a		
result		
of		
a		
law-enforcement		
bullet		
in		
the		
Louis		
H.		
Pink		
Houses		
in		
East		
New		
York		 
,		
in		
Brooklyn		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Gurley		 
,		
followed		
by		
his		
girlfriend		 
,		
was		
heading		
down		
the		
stairs		 
,		
having		
given		
up		
on		
an		
interminably		
slow		
elevator		 
,		
when		
he		
fell		
into		
the		
path		
of		
Peter		
Liang		 
,		
a		
rookie		
police		
officer		
of		
roughly		
the		
same		
age		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Liang		
was		
conducting		
what		
is		
known		
in		
Police		
Department		
vernacular		
as		
a		
"		 
vertical		 
,		 
"		
a		
descending		
check		
of		
rooftops		 
,		
stairwells		
and		
halls		
in		
public		
housing		
to		
ensure		
that		
criminals		
are		
n't		
conspiring		
there		 
.		 
Though		  
Police		
Commissioner		
William		
J.		
Bratton		
was		
quick		
to		
call		
the		
shooting		
an		
accident		
--		
and		
quick		
to		
acknowledge		
the		
victim		
as		
"		 
a		
total		
innocent		 
"		
--		
it		
will		
be		
left		
to		
an		
investigation		
to		
reveal		
precisely		
what		
happened		 
.		 
What		 
we		
do		
know		
is		
that		
when		
the		
two		
men		
entered		
it		 
,		
the		
stairway		
was		
pitch		
black		 
;		
a		
light		
meant		
to		
illuminate		
it		
had		
long		
been		
inoperative		 
.		 
Tragedies		  
resulting		
from		
the		
impulsive		
miscalculations		
and		
failures		
of		
preventive		
policing		
--		
the		
death		
of		
Eric		
Garner		 
,		
suspected		
of		
selling		
cigarettes		
illegally		 
,		
from		
a		
chokehold		
on		
Staten		
Island		
is		
another		
recent		
and		
horrific		
example		
--		
often		
lead		
to		
criticisms		
and		
reassessments		
of		
the		
"		 
broken		
windows		 
"		
theory		 
,		
the		
idea		
that		
small-scale		
disorder		
must		
be		
combated		
to		
foreclose		
the		
possibility		
of		
greater		
menace		
and		
disruption		 
.		 
One		  
of		
the		
issues		
raised		
by		
Mr.		
Gurley		
's		
death		
is		
n't		
necessarily		
that		
"		 
broken		
windows		 
"		
has		
gone		
too		
far		 
,		
the		
common		
refrain		 
,		
but		
rather		
that		
in		
certain		
instances		
its		
most		
literal		
message		
has		
been		
fatally		
misunderstood		
or		
ignored		 
.		 
We		  
have		
come		
to		
think		
of		
"		 
broken		
windows		 
"		
in		
terms		
of		
the		
need		
to		
make		
arrests		
for		
minor		
offenses		 
,		
the		
imperative		
to		
get		
rid		
of		
squeegee		
men		
and		
other		
avatars		
of		
nuisance		 
.		 
But		 
at		
the		
heart		
of		
the		
philosophy		
is		
the		
notion		
that		
ruined		
things		
--		
broken		
windows		 
,		
cracked		
sidewalks		 
,		
littered		
pathways		
and		
so		
on		
--		
must		
get		
fixed		 
.		 
If		 
glass		
is		
left		
shattered		 
,		
for		
instance		 
,		
rather		
than		
quickly		
replaced		 
,		
vandals		
will		
break		
more		
of		
it		 
.		 
Broadly		 
speaking		 
,		
physical		
decay		
begets		
the		
moral		
kind		 
;		
appearances		
must		
be		
maintained		
for		
civility		
to		
cohere		 
.		 
Ironically		   
,		
over		
the		
past		
two		
decades		 
,		
civic		
leaders		
most		
in		
thrall		
to		
the		
theory		
have		
been		
those		
least		
eager		
to		
prioritize		
the		
problem		
of		
deterioration		
in		
the		
urban		
public		
housing		
system		 
.		 
In		 
the		
five-year		
period		
through		
2013		 
,		
as		
New		
York		
City		
's		
crime		
rate		
further		
declined		
or		
remained		
stable		 
,		
the		
crime		
rate		
in		
public		
housing		
rose		
22.5		
percent		 
.		 
That		 
period		
coincided		
with		
a		
long		
reign		
of		
neglect		
of		
the		
buildings		
of		
the		
New		
York		
City		
Housing		
Authority		 
.		 
In		 
January		
of		
last		
year		 
,		
as		
the		
end		
of		
his		
term		
approached		 
,		
Mayor		
Michael		
R.		
Bloomberg		
vowed		
to		
expedite		
repairs		 
,		
and		
he		
did		 
,		
but		
a		
backlog		
of		
420,000		
had		
accrued		 
.		 
About		  
that		
time		 
,		
I		
met		
a		
woman		
named		
Mabel		
Spence		 
,		
a		
longtime		
resident		
of		
the		
Tilden		
Houses		
in		
Brooklyn		 
,		
who		
told		
me		
that		
several		
years		
earlier		 
,		
she		
had		
taken		
to		
sitting		
on		
the		
toilet		
with		
an		
umbrella		
because		
the		
leaks		
in		
her		
bathroom		
had		
become		
so		
severe		 
.		 
She		 
had		
to		
go		
to		
court		
to		
ultimately		
get		
the		
Housing		
Authority		
to		
fix		
the		
damage		 
.		 
It		 
was		
not		
uncommon		
for		
residents		
to		
call		
with		
problems		
and		
be		
told		
the		
fixes		
could		
not		
be		
made		
for		
12		
months		
or		
more		 
.		 
Earlier		  
this		
year		 
,		
the		
Community		
Service		
Society		 
,		
a		
nonprofit		
organization		
that		
studies		
poverty		 
,		
released		
a		
report		
detailing		
the		
financial		
and		
physical		
decline		
of		
the		
city		
's		
public		
housing		
system		 
.		 
Analyzing		 
data		
from		
the		
Housing		
Vacancy		
Survey		
on		
complaints		
about		
leaks		 
,		
cracked		
walls		 
,		
pestilence		
and		
other		
issues		
from		
low-income		
households		
across		
the		
city		 
,		
researchers		
found		
a		
pattern		
of		
escalating		
degeneration		
in		
public		
housing		 
.		 
In		 
both		
public		
and		
private		
rental		
units		 
,		
the		
proportion		
of		
households		
that		
reported		
four		
or		
more		
problems		
from		
2002		
to		
2008		
stood		
at		
12		
percent		 
.		 
From		 
2008		
to		
2011		 
,		
however		 
,		
the		
number		
of		
reports		
of		
what		
the		
study		
called		
"		 
multiple		
deficiencies		 
"		
nearly		
doubled		
in		
apartments		
belonging		
to		
the		
Housing		
Authority		 
.		 
In		  
July		 
,		
Mayor		
Bill		
de		
Blasio		
announced		
an		
initiative		
to		
reduce		
violent		
crime		
in		
the		
city		
's		
public		
housing		
developments		 
;		
his		
plan		
made		
a		
point		
of		
connecting		
safety		
to		
physical		
improvements		 
.		 
Although		 
the		
overall		
crime		
rate		
in		
public		
housing		
is		
down		
by		
5		
percent		
during		
the		
first		
year		
of		
the		
mayor		
's		
term		 
,		
shootings		
have		
increased		
16		
percent		 
.		 
Of		 
the		
$	CURRENCY	 
210		
million		
committed		
to		
the		
initiative		 
,		
which		
focuses		
on		
the		
15		
developments		
responsible		
for		
20		
percent		
of		
all		
violent		
crime		
in		
public		
housing		 
,		
$	CURRENCY	 
122		
million		
will		
be		
put		
toward		
maintenance		
and		
repairs		 
,		
and		
more		
than		
$	CURRENCY	 
51		
million		
toward		
security-enhancement		
measures		
like		
exterior		
lighting		 
.		 
Bureaucracies		  
are		
not		
known		
for		
producing		
100		
percent		
efficiency		 
,		
but		
the		
de		
Blasio		
administration		
seems		
to		
recognize		
that		
the		
debate		
around		
crime-solving		
should		
not		
focus		
solely		
on		
the		
value		
of		
different		
policing		
styles		 
.		 
Mr.		  
Gurley		
's		
death		
has		
renewed		
discussion		
about		
the		
efficacy		
of		
vertical		
patrols		 
,		
a		
practice		
law		
enforcement		
finds		
essential		
and		
critics		
of		
aggressive		
policing		
have		
found		
problematic		 
.		 
As		 
it		
happens		 
,		
the		
number		
of		
these		
patrols		
conducted		
in		
public		
housing		
has		
decreased		
20		
percent		
this		
year		 
.		 
Some		 
lives		
might		
ultimately		
be		
saved		
by		
the		
mere		
effort		
of		
getting		
on		
a		
ladder		
and		
fixing		
the		
lights		 
.
