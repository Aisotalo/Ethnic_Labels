Ferguson		  
police		
fumbled		
protests		 
The		  
following		
editorial		
appeared		
in		
Friday		
's		
Washington		
Post		 
:		 
From		  
the		
chief		
of		
the		
police		
department		
to		
the		
president		
of		
the		
United		
States		 
,		
government		
officials		
on		
Thursday		
promised		
a		
different		
approach		
to		
the		
racially		
charged		
unrest		
in		
the		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		
of		
Ferguson		 
.		 
But		 
the		
situation		
demands		
a		
lot		
more		
than		
a		
stand-down		
by		
assault-rifle-toting		
police		 
.		 
It		 
might		
require		
an		
act		
of		
Congress		 
.		 
Ferguson		  
Police		
Chief		
Thomas		
Jackson		
said		
officers		
would		
"		 
facilitate		 
"		
protests		 
,		
which		
began		
on		
Sunday		
after		
a		
police		
officer		
shot		
an		
unarmed		
black		
teenager		
on		
Saturday		 
.		 
President		 
Barack		
Obama		
assured		
the		
country		
that		
the		
FBI		
and		
the		
Justice		
Department		
were		
keeping		
a		
close		
eye		
on		
how		
local		
officials		
were		
handling		
the		
shooting		
investigation		
and		
the		
outraged		
street		
demonstrators		 
.		 
Some		 
of		
those		
involved		
in		
forcefully		
dispersing		
protests		
wo		
n't		
have		
a		
chance		
to		
do		
better		 
:		
Missouri		
Gov.		
Jay		
Nixon		 
,		
D		 
,		
officially		
relieved		
the		
St.		
Louis		
County		
Police		 
,		
the		
principal		
authority		
on		
the		
ground		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
and		
put		
the		
Missouri		
Highway		
Patrol		
in		
charge		 
.		 
That		  
was		
justified		
in		
light		
of		
what		
Attorney		
General		
Eric		
Holder		
termed		
"		 
unnecessarily		
extreme		
displays		
of		
force		 
.		  
"		 
Nothing		
justifies		
looting		
or		
assaulting		
police		 
,		
but		
law		
enforcement		
officers		
in		
Ferguson		
did		
not		
need		
to		
respond		
to		
mostly		
peaceful		
protests		
by		
deploying		
armored		
vehicles		 
,		
pointing		
sniper		
rifles		
at		
civilians		
and		
tossing		
tear		
gas		
and		
shooting		
rubber		
bullets		
liberally		
into		
crowds		 
.		 
These		 
tactics		
have		
been		
an		
affront		
to		
a		
community		
that		
needs		
to		
be		
heard		 
,		
not		
suppressed		 
.		 
Nor		  
does		
the		
cause		
of		
public		
safety		
excuse		
the		
documented		
abuse		
of		
several		
journalists		 
,		
including		
The		
Post		
's		
Wesley		
Lowery		 
,		
whom		
police		
detained		
for		
"		 
trespassing		 
"		
in		
a		
McDonald		 
's		 
,		
and		
an		
Al		
Jazeera		
film		
crew		 
,		
which		
was		
tear-gassed		 
.		 
Our		  
objection		
to		
the		
brandishing		
of		
tools		
of		
war		
in		
a		
crowd-control		
operation		
raises		
the		
further		
question		
of		
whether		
police		
departments		
have		
obtained		
too		
much		
military		
hardware		
from		
the		
Defense		
Department		 
.		 
Police		 
officers		
with		
the		
wrong		
attitude		
can		
do		
a		
lot		
of		
damage		
with		
a		
nightstick		
or		
a		
pistol		 
.		 
It		 
would		
be		
a		
good		
idea		
for		
the		
Pentagon		
to		
reconsider		
whether		
a		
local		
police		
force		
should		
ever		
need		 
,		
say		 
,		
a		
mine-resistant		
armored		
vehicle		 
.		 
Congress		  
,		
too		 
,		
could		
take		
more		
control		
of		
the		
equipment-transfer		
policy		 
,		
in		
place		
since		
1990		 
.		 
We		  
are		
glad		
to		
see		
that		
several		
successive		
nights		
of		
chaos		
seem		
to		
have		
snapped		
state		
and		
local		
leaders		
to		
attention		 
.		 
But		 
they		
should		
have		
reacted		
days		
ago		 
.		 
Instead		  
,		
they		
let		
angry		
feelings		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
already		
festering		
in		
a		
mostly		
AfricanAmerican		
town		
with		
a		
white-dominated		
police		
force		 
,		
expand		
further		 
.		 
Police		 
can		
only		
do		
their		
jobs		
if		
they		
have		
a		
basic		
level		
of		
trust		
from		
the		
community		
they		
are		
charged		
with		
protecting		 
.		 
If		 
that		
existed		
before		
the		
recent		
events		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
it		
does		
not		
now		 
.		 
The		  
next		
steps		
must		
include		
the		
deescalation		
that		
leaders		
are		
promising		 
,		
a		
full		
and		
fair		
investigation		
into		
the		
shooting		
and		
a		
thorough		
review		
of		
Ferguson		
's		
and		
St.		
Louis		
County		
's		
police		
training		
and		
staffing		
policies		 
.		 
The		 
Obama		
administration		
deserves		
credit		
for		
pushing		
its		
investigation		
forward		 
.		 
It		 
should		
not		
hesitate		
to		
pressure		
local		
leaders		
further		
if		
they		
continue		
to		
fumble		 
.
