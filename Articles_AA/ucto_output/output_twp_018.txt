the		
police		
barricades		
went		
up		
around		
Watts		
and		
the		
National		
Guard		
tanks		
rolled		
in

I		
remember		
being		
horrified

The		  
August		
1965		
riots		
in		
Los		
Angeles		
were		
raging		 
,		
incited		
by		
the		
arrest		
of		
a		
young		
black		
motorist		
by		
a		
white		
highway		
patrolman		 
,		
and		
a		
violent		
clash		
between		
police		
and		
the		
community

Today

watched		
escalating		
protests

crackdowns		
in

Missouri

an

sense

was		
bad

this

the

"		 
In		  
Ferguson		 
,		
where		
a		
police		
officer		
killed		
an		
unarmed		
young		
black		
man		
Saturday		 
,		
community		
anger		
has		
been		
stoked		
by		
a		
vacuum		
of		
information		
and		
the		
use		
of		
militarized		
police		
units		 
.		 
There		 
are		
always		
specific		
conditions		
that		
lead		
to		
racial		
disturbances		 
,		
but		
a		
broader		
question		
might		
be		 
:		
Why		
do		
they		
keep		
happening		 
?		 
Are		 
lessons		
ever		
learned		 
?		 
Sometimes		   
,		
but		
experts		
say		
that		
enduring		
racial		
inequality		
and		
police		
failings		
practically		
guarantee		
more		
wrongful		
killings		
and		
civil		
disorder		 
.		 
"		   
It		
's		
a		
darn		
shame		 
,		 
"		
Fred		
Harris		
says

"		  
There		
's		
too		
much		
of		
this		
going		
on

police		
shooting		
people

"		 
Harris		   
,		
an		
83		 
-		
year-old		
former		
Democratic		
senator		
from		
Oklahoma		 
,		
has		
a		
unique		
perspective		
on		
recurring		
racial		
tensions		
and		
police		
violence		
in		
America		 
.		 
He		 
is		
one		
of		
the		
last		
living		
members		
of		
the		
Kerner		
Commission		 
,		
which		
examined		
the		
social		
inequalities		
that		
led		
to		
rioting		
in		
black		
communities		
in		
Detroit		 
,		
Newark		
and		
21		
other		
cities		
in		
1967		 
.		 
It		 
also		
made		
recommendations		
to		
reduce		
police		
overreaction		
to		
protests		 
,		
build		
trust		
within		
communities		
and		
increase		
racial		
diversity		
of		
police		
forces		 
.		 
"		   
With		
all		
that		
's		
happening		
in		
Ferguson		 
,		
I		
'm		
hoping		
we		
can		
go		
back		
to		
recommendations		
we		
had		
on		
the		
Kerner		
Commission		 
,		 
"		
Harris		 
,		
a		
political		
science		
professor		
at		
the		
University		
of		
New		
Mexico		 
,		
said		
Thursday		 
.		 
But		  
across		
the		
country		 
,		
experts		
say		 
,		
many		
police		
forces		
have		
yet		
to		
adopt		
some		
of		
the		
most		
basic		
techniques		
to		
curb		
the		
possibility		
of		
police		
brutality		
and		
subsequent		
unrest		 
.		 
These		 
strategies		
include		
having		
police		
live		
in		
the		
communities		
where		
they		
enforce		
the		
law		
and		
building		
connections		
with		
the		
residents		 
.		 
"		   
The		
only		
way		
to		
stop		
these		
situations		
is		
before		
they		
happen		 
,		
not		
after		
they		
happen		 
,		 
"		
said		
Chuck		
Wexler		 
,

law-enforcement		
expert		
who		
has		
studied		
federal		
civil		
rights		
investigations		
of		
local		
police		
departments		 
.		 
"		   
It		
's		
particularly		
important		
to		
establish		
credibility		
with		
the		
community		 
,		
and		
particularly		
with		
the		
black		
community		 
,		
because		
there		
is		
n't		
a		
built-up		
reservoir		
of		
trust

"		 
He		  
recalled		
what		
an		
aide		
to		
Nation		
of		
Islam		
leader		
Louis		
Farrakhan		
once		
told		
him		 
:		
"		 
Make		
friends		
before		
you		
need		
them		 
.		 
"		 
"		   
The		
default		
is		
to		
have		
this		
strained		
relationship		
between		
the		
police		
and		
communities		
of		
color		 
.		 
That		 
emanates		
from		
our		
history

Where		
there		
is		
trust

confidence

that		
's		
been		
produced		
with		
a		
lot

hard		
work		
on

law		
enforcement

"		 
Among		  
the		
trust-building		
tactics

putting		
out		
information		
quickly

owning		
up		
to		
mistakes

which

protesters		
point		
out

not		
happened		
in

With		  
18,000		
police		
departments		
in		
the		
United		
States		 
,		
achieving		
a		
conformity		
in

community		
relations		
is		
impossible

"		   
However		 
,		
so		
much		
has		
been		
accomplished		
in		
the		
past		
20		
years

written		
about		
that		
today

As

he		
has		
worked		
with		
a		
number		
of		
police		
forces		
that		
have		
struggled		
with		
racial		
incidents

working		
with		
the

after		
the		
arrest		
of

one		
titled		
"

"		
which		
was		
revisited		
after		
four

unarmed		
immigrant

"		   
We		
did		
all		
of		
these		
hearings		
on		
police		
issues		 
,		 
"		
she		
recalls		 
.		 
"		  
The		
police		
said		
they		
were		
always		
afraid		
and		
-		
no		
matter		
how		
much		
training		
they		
had		
-		
that		
a		
natural		
reaction		
was		
to		
think		
about		
reaching		
for		
the		
gun		 
.		 
"		 
A		  
questionable		
shooting		
is		
certain		
to		
cause		
questions		
and		
anger		 
,		
but		
some		
academics		
also		
point		
to		
a		
broader		
context		
of		
inequality		
for		
blacks		 
:		
more		
poverty		 
,		
lower		
education		
and		
income		
rates		 
,		
continued		
residential		
segregation

"

Those		  
protests		
and		
later		
race		
riots		
spawned		
a		
library		
of		
books		
and		
reports		 
,		
many		
aimed		
at		
making		
sure		
that		
kind		
of		
conflict		
never		
engulfed		
another

on
