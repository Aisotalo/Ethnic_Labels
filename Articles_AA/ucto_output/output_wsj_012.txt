focus		
on

Garner		
's		
death		
on		
Staten		
Island		 
.		 
Mr.		 
Brown		
's		
family		
's		
presence		
will		
depend		
on		
the		
timing		
of

which		
is		
contingent		
on		
the		
completion		
of		
several		
autopsies

the

said

Attorneys		  
for

Protesters		  
plan		
to		
march		
to		
the		
Staten

district		
attorney		
's		
office		
from		
the		
scene		
where		
Mr.		
Garner		
died		
during		
an		
arrest		
attempt		 
.		 
A		 
video		
appeared		
to		
show		
Mr.		
Garner		
resisting		
before		
an		
officer		
placed		
him		
in		
a		
chokehold		 
,		
a		
maneuver		
the		
New		
York		
Police		
Department		
generally		
does		
n't		
allow		 
.		 
The		 
medical		
examiner		
's		
office		
ruled		
the		
death		
a		
homicide		 
.		 
Civil		  
rights		
leaders		
such		
as		
the		
Revs		 
.		 
Sharpton		 
and		
Jesse		
Jackson		
have		
said		
both		
deaths		
are		
tied		
by		
a		
combustible		
alchemy		
of		
race		 
,		
a		
focus		
on		
low-level		
crime		
and		
police		
use		
of		
force		 
.		 
"		   
There		
's		
a		
pattern		
here		 
.		 
And		 
the		
pattern		
is		
a		
predisposition		
toward		
disproportionate		
force		 
,		
toward		
violence		 
,		
on		
black		
men		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Jackson		
said		
in		
a		
telephone		
interview		
from		
Ferguson		 
.		 
"		   
Both		
of		
them		
were		
victims		
of		
this		
aggressive		
policing		
of		
low-level		
crime		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Sharpton		
said		
Saturday		
of		
Messrs.		
Garner		
and		
Brown		 
.		 
A		  
spokeswoman		
for		
Mayor		
Bill		
de		
Blasio		
referred		
to		
remarks		
the		
mayor		
made		
last		
week		 
,		
calling		
the		
Garner		
case		
part		
of		
"		 
a		
very		
different		
reality		 
"		
than		
Mr.		
Brown		 
's		 
.		 
Other		  
march		
organizers		
say		
anger		
over		
the		
death		
of		
Mr.		
Brown		
will		
be		
as		
visceral		
a		
presence		
at		
the		
rally		
as		
that		
of		
Mr.		
Garner		 
's		 
.		 
Hundreds		 
of		
people		
filled		
New		
York		
's		
streets		
last		
week		
to		
protest		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
death		
in		
mostly		
peaceful		
demonstrations		 
.		 
Several		 
thousand		
are		
expected		
Saturday		 
.		 
"		   
The		
deaths		
have		
hit		
a		
nerve		
in		
our		
communities		 
,		
some		
New		
Yorkers		
have		
gone		
to		
Missouri		
to		
protest		 
,		 
"		
said		
Javier		
Valdes		 
,		
the		
co-executive		
director		
of		
Make		
the		
Road		
New		
York		 
,		
which		
pushes		
for		
more		
liberal		
policing		
strategies		 
.		 
Among		  
those		
who		
agree		
are		
Mr.		
Garner		
's		
mother		 
,		
Gwen		
Carr		 
,		
who		
said		
on		
Saturday		
that		
the		
march		
would		
be		
"		 
not		
only		
for		
my		
son		 
,		
you		
know		 
,		
it		
's		
for		
Michael		
Brown		
from		
Ferguson		 
,		
Mo.		 
"		 
Some		  
Staten		
Island		
elected		
officials		
oppose		
the		
march		 
.		 
U.S.		 
Rep.		
Michael		
Grimm		 
,		
a		
Republican		 
,		
said		
the		
event		
will		
give		
credibility		
to		
an		
"		 
all		
too		
convenient		
stereotype		
that		
Staten		
Island		
is		
racist		 
.		 
"		 
Ed		  
Mullins		 
,		
president		
of		
the		
city		
's		
Sergeants		
Benevolent		
Association		 
,		
a		
labor		
union		 
,		
said		
officers		
should		
n't		
be		
penalized		
for		
enforcing		
the		
law		 
,		
no		
matter		
how		
minor		
the		
infraction		 
.		 
"		   
It		
's		
not		
true		
that		
we		
're		
racist		 
,		
that		
we		
do		
n't		
care		
about		
these		
communities		 
.		 
We		 
do		
care
