After		  
Disputed		
Verdict		 
,		
Reckoning		
for		
Ferguson		 
FERGUSON		   
,		
Mo.		
--		
It		
was		
never		
much		 
,		
a		
faded		
commercial		
strip		
on		
a		
stretch		
that		
drew		
people		
from		
the		
apartments		
nearby		
for		
most		
of		
the		
essentials		 
.		 
You		 
could		
pick		
up		
milk		
at		
the		
convenience		
store		 
,		
get		
a		
manicure		
at		
Crystal		
Nails		 
,		
wash		
your		
clothes		
at		
the		
Ferguson		
Laundry		 
.		 
On		 
a		
busy		
Friday		
night		 
,		
men		
would		
gather		
to		
talk		
and		
watch		
sports		
on		
television		
at		
the		
barber		
shop		
as		
they		
got		
straight		
razor		
shaves		 
.		 
But		  
West		
Florissant		
Avenue		 
,		
in		
its		
modest		
way		 
,		
was		
the		
heart		
of		
the		
neighborhood		
where		
Michael		
Brown		
died		 
,		
and		
the		
scene		
of		
the		
protests		
that		
followed		
his		
shooting		
in		
August		 
.		 
Now		  
--		
with		
police		
officers		
directing		
most		
traffic		
away		 
,		
and		
yellow		
tape		
and		
parked		
squad		
cars		
blocking		
off		
access		
--		
it		
is		
something		
very		
different		 
:		
a		
desolate		
crime		
scene		 
,		
and		
a		
bitter		
symbol		
of		
what		
has		
been		
lost		
and		
how		
hard		
it		
will		
be		
to		
crawl		
back		
to		
some		
semblance		
of		
normalcy		
after		
this		
week		
's		
arson		 
,		
looting		
and		
destruction		 
.		 
The		  
images		
are		
the		
sort		
more		
often		
seen		
after		
a		
tornado		
has		
spun		
through		
a		
town		 
.		 
The		 
five-lane		
road		
was		
lined		
with		
empty		
buildings		
boarded		
up		
for		
protection		 
,		
and		
punctuated		
by		
mounds		
of		
rubble		
where		
others		
had		 
,		
just		
last		
weekend		 
,		
stood		 
.		 
Gone		 
are		
auto		
parts		
stores		 
,		
Beauty		
Town		
and		
a		
title		
loan		
company		
--		
the		
victims		
of		
arson		
that		
followed		
a		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
on		
Monday		
not		
to		
indict		
a		
white		
police		
officer		
in		
the		
fatal		
shooting		
of		
Mr.		
Brown		 
.		 
Even		  
the		
storefront		
office		
of		
Antonio		
French		 
,		
a		
local		
politician		
who		
was		
an		
outspoken		
leader		
amid		
the		
protests		
over		
the		
shooting		 
,		
has		
been		
destroyed		 
.		 
No		  
other		
place		
took		
the		
pummeling		
of		
rioting		
here		
on		
Monday		
night		
like		
these		
approximately		
six		
blocks		
of		
West		
Florissant		
Avenue		 
.		 
The		 
strip		 
,		
with		
its		
squat		
buildings		
and		
loud		
signs		 
,		
had		
already		
come		
back		
from		
a		
lesser		
battering		
in		
August		 
,		
when		
demonstrations		
and		
tear		
gas		
followed		
Mr.		
Brown		
's		
death		 
.		 
One		 
business		 
,		
a		
QuikTrip		
convenience		
store		 
,		
had		
been		
burned		
back		
then		 
.		 
But		 
now		 
,		
residents		
and		
shop		
owners		 
,		
exhausted		
from		
so		
much		
tumult		 
,		
said		
they		
were		
uncertain		
whether		
this		
stretch		
had		
a		
future		
at		
all		 
.		 
Some		  
owners		 
,		
still		
reeling		 
,		
said		
they		
had		
not		
decided		
whether		
to		
rebuild		
or		
return		 
.		 
Would		 
anyone		
insure		
them		 
?		 
More		 
than		
that		 
,		
would		
anyone		
want		
to		
come		 
?		 
In		  
a		
way		 
,		
the		
questions		
about		
the		
future		
of		
a		
few		
blocks		
of		
West		
Florissant		
were		
larger		
than		
the		
individual		
stores		
that		
once		
lined		
the		
avenue		 
.		 
If		 
the		
commercial		
strip		
here		
were		
to		
vanish		 
,		
what		
would		
that		
mean		
for		
the		
fate		
of		
the		
neighborhood		 
?		 
Kizzie		  
Davis		 
,		
an		
owner		
of		
Ferguson		
Burger		
Bar		
and		
More		 
,		
which		
was		
unharmed		
in		
the		
unrest		
but		 
,		
like		
everything		
else		 
,		
was		
closed		
on		
Wednesday		 
,		
said		
she		
was		
unsure		
if		
West		
Florissant		
could		
recover		 
.		 
"		  
I		
think		
that		
anything		
is		
possible		 
,		 
"		
she		
said		 
.		 
"		  
However		 
,		
it		
may		
take		
a		
while		 
.		 
"		 
Like		  
West		
Florissant		 
,		
Ferguson		
itself		
has		
wrestled		
over		
time		
to		
bolster		
its		
standing		 
,		
a		
possibility		
that		
seems		
much		
more		
remote		
now		
that		
its		
name		
has		
become		
shorthand		
for		
racial		
turmoil		 
.		 
In		  
2010		 
,		
this		
small		
St.		
Louis		
suburb		
was		
in		
the		
running		
to		
be		
named		
an		
All-America		
City		
by		
the		
National		
Civic		
League		 
.		 
It		 
just		
missed		
the		
cutoff		
because		
it		
did		
not		
have		
a		
youth		
association		 
,		
said		
Brian		
Fletcher		 
,		
a		
former		
mayor		
and		
chairman		
of		
the		
"		 
I		
Love		
Ferguson		 
"		
committee		
that		
sprang		
up		
after		
the		
August		
unrest		 
.		 
"		   
I		
suspect		 
,		 
"		
Mr.		
Fletcher		
said		
on		
Sunday		 
,		
the		
night		
before		
the		
rioting		
on		
West		
Florissant		 
,		
"		 
we		
'll		
be		
filing		
another		
application		
to		
see		
if		
we		
're		
worthy		
of		
the		
award		 
.		 
"		 
For		  
years		 
,		
this		
stretch		
of		
road		
was		
practical		 
,		
not		
fancy		 
.		 
In		 
its		
beauty		
supply		
stores		 
,		
Chinese		
restaurants		 
,		
storefront

,		
Original		
Red		
's		
BBQ		 
,		
liquor		
store		 
,		
burger		
joint		
and		
check		
cashing		
store		 
,		
residents		
got		
what		
they		
needed		 
,		
met		
and		
mingled		 
.		 
Officials		 
studied		
the		
thoroughfare		
at		
various		
points		 
,		
noting		 
,		
in		
one		
draft		
report		
from		
2012		 
,		
its		
strengths		
(		 
"		
loyal		
patron		
base

and		
high		
traffic		 
)		
and		
its		
weaknesses		
(

)

"		   
I		
love		
this

said		
LaMont		
Brown		 
,		
58		 
,		
who		
lives		
not		
far		
from		
here		
and		
said		
he		
spent		
time		
in		
these		
businesses		
almost		
every		
day		 
.		 
"		  
This		
is		
where		
I		
live

"		   
It		
's		
just		
so		
unbelievable

he		
added

Dellena		  
Jones		
said		
her		
business		 
,		
911		
Hair		
Salon		 
,		
was		
untouched		 
.		 
But		 
the		
devastation		
to		
stores		
just		
down		
the		
way		
also		
threatened		
hers		 
.		 
"		  
It		
still		
stops		
clients		
and		
people		
from		
wanting		
to		
come		
into		
the		
area

she		
said

"		   
Beauty

she

Just		  
this		
summer		 
,		
West		
Florissant		
was		
the		
scene		
of		
night		
after		
night		
of		
fierce		
demonstrations		 
.		 
At		 
times		 
,		
the		
clashes		
with		
the		
police		
grew		
violent		 
;		
clouds		
of		
tear		
gas		
filled		
the		
street		 
,		
and		
helicopters		
flew		
by		 
.		 
Some		 
stores		
reported		
looting		 
,		
and		
the		
QuikTrip		
was		
burned		 
,		
leaving		
owners		
nervous		 
.		 
As		  
word		
spread		
in		
recent		
weeks		
that		
the		
grand		
jury		
would		
soon		
announce		
whether		
the		
officer		 
,		
Darren		
Wilson		 
,		
would		
be		
indicted		 
,		
many		
stores		
put		
wooden		
boards		
on		
their		
windows		
and		
sought		
assurances		
from		
the		
authorities		
that		
they		
would		
be		
safe

Jay		  
L.		
Kanzler		
Jr.		 
,		
a		
lawyer		
who		
represents		
four		
businesses		
here		 
,		
said		
he		
had		
held		
a		
meeting		
in		
a		
shop		
on		
West		
Florissant		
just		
last		
Friday		
and		
had		
thought		
he		
had		
assurances		
from		
Justice		
Department		
officials		
that		
business		
owners		
would		
be		
protected		 
.		 
"		  
They		
kept		
saying

Mr.

On		  
Monday		
night		 
,		
as		
word		
of		
the		
grand		
jury		
's		
decision		
spread		 
,		
chaos		
gripped		
the		
area		 
.		 
Looters		 
clutched		
bottles		
as		
they		
climbed		
from		
broken		
windows		
at		
Ferguson		
Market		
and		
Liquor

Smoke		 
filled		
the		
street

Flames		 
shots		
from		
the		
windows		
of		
some		
businesses		 
,		
and		
law		
enforcement		
officials		
said		
the		
conditions

gunshots		
and		
thrown		
objects		
--		
threatened		
firefighters		 
.		 
By		  
Wednesday		
afternoon		 
,		
the		
avenue		
was		
largely		
deserted		 
,		
as		
snow		
gathered		
on		
the		
charred		
remains		
of		
AutoZone

Beauty		
Town		
and		
Juanita

Fashions		
R		
Boutique

Despite		 
the		
cold		 
,		
TitleMax		
continued		
to		
smolder		 
.		 
At		 
least		
eight		
businesses		
had		
been		
set		
on		
fire		 
,		
and		
what		
was		
left		
were		
images		
as		
if

a		
natural		
disaster
