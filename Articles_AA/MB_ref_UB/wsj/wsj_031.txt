U.S. News: Ferguson Gets Ready While Jury Deliberates

FERGUSON, Mo. -- Protests continued here through the weekend, as residents, police and demonstrators brace for a decision from a grand jury set to reconvene Monday in the case of a racially charged police shooting that brought weeks of unrest during the summer.

On Sunday, protesters renewed complaints about the secretive grand jury process when a St. Louis County court administrator released an open letter that said documents related to the case wouldn't necessarily be released to the public.

"If the grand jury returns a no true bill, the judge anticipates the court will receive requests for grand jury records," said Paul Fox, court administrator in the letter. "The court will thereafter be guided by the law in its response to requests for grand jury records."

Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecutor, who convened the grand jury, had pledged to push for the release of as many documents as possible if the grand jury doesn't indict white Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson in the Aug. 9 shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

Meanwhile, as protests continued police honed their response to the crowds. On Saturday night, demonstrations in front of the Ferguson Police Department led to two more arrests even as St. Louis County Police leaders tried a less-confrontational approach that cooled tempers but didn't eliminate conflict.

During past nights' civil disobedience, police simply formed skirmish lines while wearing riot gear and pushed into crowds to make arrests after a few warnings announced over loudspeakers. But beginning on Friday, police started using less-confrontational tactics, eschewing shotguns with nonlethal rounds they had carried earlier in the week. Many officers on Saturday wore standard patrol uniforms, rather than crowd-control gear.

All across the St. Louis area, people continued to board up and barricade businesses and government buildings.
