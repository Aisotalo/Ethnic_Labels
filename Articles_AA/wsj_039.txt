U.S. News: Civil Rights Case Is Seen As Difficult To Bring

WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday the government would try to help identify "criminal elements" behind the rioting in Ferguson, Mo., following a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the shooting of an unarmed black man.

Mr. Holder promised a thorough and independent federal civil rights probe of the Aug. 9 shooting of Michael Brown, 18 years old, by Officer Darren Wilson. The Justice Department is likely several weeks away from deciding whether to file charges against the officer, according to officials.

Legal observers say bringing civil rights charges against Mr. Wilson would be difficult since the standard is higher for a federal case than for a state criminal prosecution.

Under federal civil rights law, Justice Department prosecutors would have to show that Mr. Wilson intended to deprive the victim of his civil rights in their confrontation.

"The willfulness requirement makes it especially hard to prove these cases,"" said Samuel Bagenstos, a former top civil rights official in the Justice Department who now teaches law at the University of Michigan. "I wouldn't have very high expectations.""

The prosecutors wouldn't have to show Mr. Wilson acted with racial animus, but they would have to show Mr. Brown didn't pose a threat, and that a reasonable police officer in the same situation would have realized Mr. Brown wasn't a threat.

The Justice Department has opened a "pattern and practice"" probe of the 53-employee Ferguson police department, looking for flaws in training, hiring, stops, use of force, and other areas. Such probes aren't designed to bring criminal charges, but to identify departments whose practices need improvement. Any outcome of that probe is likely months away, according to officials.
